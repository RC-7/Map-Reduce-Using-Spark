 introduction analysis.

 republic plato longest works exception
 laws, certainly greatest them. nearer
 approaches modern metaphysics philebus sophist;
 politicus statesman ideal; form institutions
 state clearly drawn laws; works art,
 symposium protagoras higher excellence.
 dialogue plato largeness view perfection
 style; shows equal knowledge world, contains
 thoughts new well old, one age
 all. nowhere plato deeper irony greater
 wealth humour imagery, dramatic power.
 writings attempt made interweave life speculation,
 connect politics philosophy. republic centre around
 dialogues may grouped; philosophy reaches
 highest point (cp, especially books v, vi, vii) ancient
 thinkers ever attained. plato among greeks, like bacon among
 moderns, first conceived method knowledge, although
 neither always distinguished bare outline form
 substance truth; content
 abstraction science yet realized. greatest
 metaphysical genius world seen; him,
 ancient thinker, germs future knowledge contained.
 sciences logic psychology, supplied many
 instruments thought after-ages, based upon analyses
 socrates plato. principles definition, law
 contradiction, fallacy arguing circle, distinction
 essence accidents thing notion, means
 ends, causes conditions; also division mind
 rational, concupiscent, irascible elements, pleasures
 desires necessary unnecessary--these great
 forms thought found republic,
 probably first invented plato. greatest logical truths,
 one writers philosophy apt lose sight,
 difference words things, strenuously
 insisted (cp. rep.; polit.; cratyl. 435, 436 ff), although
 always avoided confusion writings (e.g.
 rep.). bind truth logical formulae,--logic
 still veiled metaphysics; science imagines
 'contemplate truth existence' unlike doctrine
 syllogism aristotle claims discovered (soph. elenchi,
 33. 18).

 neither must forget republic third part
 still larger design included ideal history
 athens, well political physical philosophy. fragment
 critias given birth world-famous fiction, second
 importance tale troy legend arthur; said
 fact inspired early navigators sixteenth
 century. mythical tale, subject history
 wars athenians island atlantis, supposed
 founded upon unfinished poem solon, would stood
 relation writings logographers poems
 homer. would told struggle liberty (cp. tim. 25 c), intended
 represent conflict persia hellas. may judge
 noble commencement timaeus, fragment critias
 itself, third book laws, manner plato would
 treated high argument. guess great design
 abandoned; perhaps plato became sensible incongruity
 fictitious history, lost interest it,
 advancing years forbade completion it; may please
 fancy imaginary narrative ever
 finished, found plato sympathising
 struggle hellenic independence (cp. laws iii. 698 ff.), singing
 hymn triumph marathon salamis, perhaps making reflection
 herodotus (v. 78) contemplates growth athenian
 empire--'how brave thing freedom speech, made
 athenians far exceed every state hellas greatness!' or,
 probably, attributing victory ancient good order
 athens favor apollo athene (cp. introd. critias).

 again, plato may regarded 'captain' ('arhchegoz') leader
 goodly band followers; republic found
 original cicero's de republica, st. augustine's city god,
 utopia sir thomas more, numerous imaginary
 states framed upon model. extent
 aristotle aristotelian school indebted
 politics little recognised, recognition
 necessary made aristotle himself. two
 philosophers common conscious of;
 probably elements plato remain still undetected aristotle.
 english philosophy too, many affinities may traced,
 works cambridge platonists, great original writers like
 berkeley coleridge, plato ideas. truth
 higher experience, mind bears witness herself,
 conviction generation enthusiastically
 asserted, perhaps gaining ground. greek authors
 renaissance brought new life world plato greatest
 influence. republic plato also first treatise upon
 education, writings milton locke, rousseau, jean
 paul, goethe legitimate descendants. like dante bunyan,
 revelation another life; like bacon, profoundly
 impressed unity knowledge; early church exercised
 real influence theology, revival literature
 politics. even fragments words 'repeated second-hand'
 (symp. 215 d) ages ravished hearts men, seen
 reflected higher nature. father idealism
 philosophy, politics, literature. many latest
 conceptions modern thinkers statesmen, unity
 knowledge, reign law, equality sexes,
 anticipated dream him.

 argument republic search justice, nature

 revelation future life.

 division books, like similar divisions (cp. sir g.c. lewis
 classical museum, vol. ii. p 1.), probably later age plato.
 natural divisions five number;--(1) book first half
 book ii paragraph beginning, 'i always admired
 genius glaucon adeimantus,' introductory; first
 book containing refutation popular sophistical notions
 justice, concluding, like earlier dialogues, without
 arriving definite result. appended restatement
 nature justice according common opinion, answer
 demanded question--what justice, stripped appearances?
 second division (2) includes remainder second whole
 third fourth books, mainly occupied
 construction first state first education. third
 division (3) consists fifth, sixth, seventh books,
 philosophy rather justice subject enquiry,
 second state constructed principles communism ruled
 philosophers, contemplation idea good takes place
 social political virtues. eighth ninth books (4)
 perversions states individuals correspond
 reviewed succession; nature pleasure principle
 tyranny analysed individual man. tenth book
 (5) conclusion whole, relations philosophy
 poetry finally determined, happiness citizens
 life, assured, crowned vision
 another.

 general division two parts may adopted; first
 (books - iv) containing description state framed generally
 accordance hellenic notions religion morality,
 second (books v - x) hellenic state transformed
 ideal kingdom philosophy, governments
 perversions. two points view really opposed,
 opposition veiled genius plato. republic, like
 phaedrus (see introduction phaedrus), imperfect whole;
 higher light philosophy breaks regularity
 hellenic temple, last fades away heavens. whether
 imperfection structure arises enlargement plan;
 imperfect reconcilement writer's mind
 struggling elements thought first brought together
 him; or, perhaps, composition work different
 times--are questions, like similar question iliad
 odyssey, worth asking, cannot distinct
 answer. age plato regular mode publication,
 author would less scruple altering adding
 work known friends. absurdity
 supposing may laid labours aside time,
 turned one work another; interruptions would
 likely occur case long short writing.
 attempts determine chronological order platonic writings
 internal evidence, uncertainty single dialogue
 composed one time disturbing element, must admitted
 affect longer works, republic laws,
 shorter ones. but, hand, seeming discrepancies
 republic may arise discordant elements
 philosopher attempted unite single whole, perhaps without
 able recognise inconsistency obvious
 us. judgment ages great writers
 ever able anticipate themselves. perceive
 want connexion writings, gaps systems
 visible enough come them. beginnings
 literature philosophy, amid first efforts thought
 language, inconsistencies occur now, paths
 speculation well worn meaning words precisely defined.
 consistency, too, growth time; greatest
 creations human mind wanting unity. tried
 test, several platonic dialogues, according modern ideas,
 appear defective, deficiency proof
 composed different times different hands. supposition
 republic written uninterruptedly continuous effort
 degree confirmed numerous references one part
 work another.

 second title, 'concerning justice,' one
 republic quoted, either aristotle generally antiquity, and,
 like second titles platonic dialogues, may therefore
 assumed later date. morgenstern others asked
 whether definition justice, professed aim,
 construction state principal argument work.
 answer is, two blend one, two faces
 truth; justice order state, state
 visible embodiment justice conditions human society.
 one soul body, greek ideal
 state, individual, fair mind fair body. hegelian
 phraseology state reality justice idea. or,
 described christian language, kingdom god within, yet
 developes church external kingdom; 'the house made
 hands, eternal heavens,' reduced proportions
 earthly building. or, use platonic image, justice state
 warp woof run whole texture.
 constitution state completed, conception justice
 dismissed, reappears different names throughout
 work, inner law individual soul, finally
 principle rewards punishments another life. virtues
 based justice, common honesty buying selling
 shadow, justice based idea good,
 harmony world, reflected institutions
 states motions heavenly bodies (cp. tim. 47). timaeus,
 takes political rather ethical side
 republic, chiefly occupied hypotheses concerning outward
 world, yet contains many indications law supposed
 reign state, nature, man.

 much, however, made question ancient
 modern times. stage criticism works, whether
 nature art, referred design. ancient writings,
 indeed literature generally, remains often large element
 comprehended original design. plan grows
 author's hand; new thoughts occur act
 writing; worked argument end begins.
 reader seeks find one idea whole may
 conceived, must necessarily seize vaguest general. thus
 stallbaum, dissatisfied ordinary explanations
 argument republic, imagines found true
 argument 'in representation human life state perfected
 justice, governed according idea good.' may
 use general descriptions, hardly said express
 design writer. truth is, may well speak
 many designs one; need anything excluded plan
 great work mind naturally led association
 ideas, interfere general purpose. kind
 degree unity sought building, plastic
 arts, poetry, prose, problem determined
 relatively subject-matter. plato himself, enquiry 'what
 intention writer,' 'what principal argument
 republic' would hardly intelligible, therefore
 better dismissed (cp. introduction phaedrus).

 republic vehicle three four great truths which,
 plato's mind, naturally represented form
 state? jewish prophets reign messiah, 'the day
 lord,' suffering servant people god, 'sun
 righteousness healing wings' convey, us least,
 great spiritual ideals, greek state plato reveals
 us thoughts divine perfection, idea
 good--like sun visible world;--about human perfection,
 justice--about education beginning youth continuing later
 years--about poets sophists tyrants false teachers
 evil rulers mankind--about 'the world' embodiment
 them--about kingdom exists nowhere upon earth laid
 heaven pattern rule human life. inspired
 creation unity itself, clouds heaven
 sun pierces them. every shade light dark,
 truth, fiction veil truth, allowable work
 philosophical imagination. plane; easily
 passes ideas myths fancies, facts figures speech.
 prose poetry, least great part it, ought
 judged rules logic probabilities history.
 writer fashioning ideas artistic whole; take
 possession much him. need therefore
 discuss whether state plato conceived practicable
 not, whether outward form inward life came first
 mind writer. practicability ideas nothing
 truth; highest thoughts attains may
 truly said bear greatest 'marks design'--justice
 external frame-work state, idea good justice.
 great science dialectic organisation ideas real
 content; type method spirit
 higher knowledge pursued spectator time
 existence. fifth, sixth, seventh books plato
 reaches 'summit speculation,' these, although fail
 satisfy requirements modern thinker, may therefore regarded
 important, also original, portions
 work.

 necessary discuss length minor question
 raised boeckh, respecting imaginary date
 conversation held (the year 411 b.c. proposed
 well other); writer fiction, especially
 writer who, like plato, notoriously careless chronology (cp. rep.,
 symp., 193 a, etc.), aims general probability. whether persons
 mentioned republic could ever met one time
 difficulty would occurred athenian reading work
 forty years later, plato time writing (any
 shakespeare respecting one dramas); need
 greatly trouble us now. yet may question answer
 'which still worth asking,' investigation shows
 cannot argue historically dates plato; would useless
 therefore waste time inventing far-fetched reconcilements
 order avoid chronological difficulties, such, example,
 conjecture c.f. hermann, glaucon adeimantus
 brothers uncles plato (cp. apol. 34 a), fancy stallbaum
 plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating dates

 cephalus, polemarchus' father, extreme old age, found
 sitting upon cushioned seat crowned sacrifice. 'you come
 oftener, socrates, old go you; time
 life, lost pleasures, care conversation.'
 socrates asks thinks age, old man replies,
 sorrows discontents age attributed
 tempers men, age time peace tyranny
 passions longer felt. yes, replies socrates, world
 say, cephalus, happy old age rich.
 'and something say, socrates, much
 imagine--as themistocles replied seriphian, "neither you,
 athenian, i, seriphian, would ever

 poor man happy age, yet bad rich man.' socrates remarks
 cephalus appears care riches, quality
 ascribes inherited, acquired them, would like
 know considers chief advantage them. cephalus
 answers old belief world grows upon
 you, done justice never compelled
 injustice poverty, never deceived anyone,

 argument, next asks, meaning word justice?
 tell truth pay debts? this? must admit
 exceptions? ought i, example, put back hands

 right mind? 'there must exceptions.' 'and yet,' says
 polemarchus, 'the definition given authority

 argument heir, polemarchus...

 description old age finished, plato, manner is,
 touched key-note whole work asking definition
 justice, first suggesting question glaucon afterwards pursues
 respecting external goods, preparing concluding mythus
 world slight allusion cephalus. portrait
 man natural frontispiece introduction long discourse
 follows, may perhaps imply perplexity
 nature justice, difficulty discerning 'who
 man.' first explanation supported saying
 simonides; socrates mind show resolution
 justice two unconnected precepts, common principle,
 fails satisfy demands dialectic.

 ...he proceeds: simonides mean saying his?
 mean give back arms madman? 'no, case,
 parties friends, evil would result. meant
 proper, good friends harm enemies.' every
 act something somebody; following analogy, socrates
 asks, due proper thing justice does, whom?
 answered justice good friends harm enemies.
 way good harm? 'in making alliances one,
 going war other.' time peace good
 justice? answer justice use contracts,
 contracts money partnerships. yes; partnerships
 man use man? 'when want
 money safely kept used.' justice useful money
 useless. another difficulty: justice, like art
 war art, must opposites, good attack well
 defence, stealing well guarding. justice
 thief, though hero notwithstanding, like autolycus, homeric hero,
 'excellent men theft perjury'--to pass
 homer simonides brought us; though forget
 thieving must good friends harm enemies.
 still arises another question: friends interpreted
 real seeming; enemies real seeming? friends
 good, enemies evil? answer is,
 must good seeming real good friends, evil
 seeming real evil enemies--good good, evil evil.
 ought render evil evil all, make
 men evil? justice produce injustice art
 horsemanship make bad horsemen, heat produce cold? final
 conclusion is, sage poet ever said return
 evil evil; maxim rich mighty man, periander,
 perdiccas, ismenias theban (about b.c. 398-381)...

 thus first stage aphoristic unconscious morality shown
 inadequate wants age; authority poets set
 aside, winding mazes dialectic make approach
 christian precept forgiveness injuries. similar words
 applied persian mystic poet divine
 questioning spirit stirred within him:--'if evil, thou
 punishest evil, difference thee me?'
 plato kheyam rise level many christian (?)
 theologians. first definition justice easily passes
 second; simple words 'to speak truth pay debts'
 substituted abstract 'to good friends harm
 enemies.' either explanations gives sufficient rule

 ...here thrasymachus, made several attempts interrupt,

 pause rushes arena, beginning, like savage animal,
 roar. 'socrates,' says, 'what folly this?--why agree
 vanquished one another pretended argument?' prohibits
 ordinary definitions justice; socrates replies

 disciple cleitophon, introduces word 'thinks;'--not actual

 evasion: though real apparent interests may differ,

 church) composed entirely good men, would affected

 present opposite...

 satire existing governments heightened simple
 apparently incidental manner last remark introduced.
 similar irony argument governors mankind
 like office, therefore demand pay.

 ...enough this: assertion thrasymachus far
 important--that unjust life gainful just. now,
 i, glaucon, convinced him, must reply him;
 try compare respective gains shall want judge
 decide us; better therefore proceed making mutual
 admissions truth one another.

 thrasymachus asserted perfect injustice gainful
 perfect justice, little hesitation induced socrates
 admit still greater paradox injustice virtue justice
 vice. socrates praises frankness, assumes attitude one
 whose wish understand meaning opponents.
 time weaving net thrasymachus finally enclosed.
 admission elicited man seeks gain
 advantage unjust only, just, unjust
 would gain advantage either. socrates, order test
 statement, employs favourite analogy arts.
 musician, doctor, skilled artist sort, seek gain
 skilled, unskilled (that say,
 works rule, standard, law, exceed it), whereas
 unskilled makes random efforts excess. thus skilled falls
 side good, unskilled side evil,
 skilled, unjust unskilled.

 great difficulty bringing thrasymachus point;
 day hot streaming perspiration, first
 time life seen blush. thesis
 injustice stronger justice yet refuted,
 socrates proceeds consideration this, which,
 assistance thrasymachus, hopes clear up; latter first
 churlish, judicious hands socrates soon restored
 good-humour: honour among thieves? strength
 injustice remnant justice? absolute injustice absolute
 weakness also? house divided cannot stand; two
 men quarrel detract one another's strength,
 war enemy gods. wickedness
 therefore, semi-wickedness flourishes states,--a remnant
 good needed order make union action possible,--there
 kingdom evil world.

 another question answered: unjust
 happier? reply, every art end excellence
 virtue end accomplished. end
 soul happiness, justice excellence soul
 happiness attained? justice happiness thus shown

 thrasymachus replies: 'let entertainment, socrates,

 good entertainment--but fault, tasted

 enquiry, whether justice virtue wisdom, evil
 folly; comparative advantages unjust:
 sum know justice is; shall know

 thus sophistical fabric demolished, chiefly appealing
 analogy arts. 'justice like arts (1)

 happiness implement workman work.'
 modern reader apt stumble, forgets plato
 writing age arts virtues, like moral
 intellectual faculties, still undistinguished. among early
 enquirers nature human action arts helped fill

 least supplied ages analysis them.
 contemporaries plato state transition, yet

 concerned action, art production' (nic. eth.),
 'virtue implies intention constancy purpose,' whereas 'art
 requires knowledge only'. yet absurdities follow

 two brothers ask socrates prove happy
 taken happiness ordinarily
 supposed consist. (1) absurdity attempt
 frame notion justice apart circumstances. ideal
 must always paradox compared ordinary conditions

 exceptional individuals raised ordinary level
 humanity, ideal happiness may realized death misery.
 may state reason deliberately approves,

 cases prefer.

 again, (2) must forget plato, though agrees generally
 view implied argument two brothers,
 expressing final conclusion, rather seeking dramatize one
 aspects ethical truth. developing idea gradually

 first time undergoing socratic interrogation. lastly, (3) word
 'happiness' involves degree confusion associated

 glaucon drawing picture misery

 answer parallel. still unjust must appear just;
 'the homage vice pays virtue.' adeimantus, taking
 hint already given glaucon, proceeds show
 opinion mankind justice regarded sake

 objected justice honesty sense glaucon
 adeimantus, taken socrates mean virtue. may
 truly say old-fashioned notion justice enlarged
 socrates, becomes equivalent universal order well-being, first
 state, secondly individual? found new answer
 old question (protag.), 'whether virtues one many,'
 viz. one ordering principle three others. seeking
 establish purely internal nature justice, met
 fact man social being, tries harmonise two
 opposite theses well can. inconsistency
 inevitable age country; use
 turning upon cross lights modern philosophy, which,
 point view, would appear equally inconsistent. plato
 give final solution philosophical questions us;
 judged standard.

 remainder republic developed question
 sons ariston. three points deserving remark
 immediately follows:--first, answer socrates altogether
 indirect. say happiness consists contemplation
 idea justice, still less tempted affirm
 stoical paradox man happy rack. first
 dwells difficulty problem insists restoring man
 natural condition, answer question all.
 frame ideal, ideal comprehends abstract
 justice, whole relations man. fanciful illustration
 large letters implies look justice
 society, state proceed individual.
 answer substance amounts this,--that favourable conditions,
 i.e. perfect state, justice happiness coincide,
 justice found, happiness may left take care
 itself. falls degree inconsistency,
 tenth book claims got rid rewards honours
 justice, may admitted; left exist
 perfect state. philosopher 'who retires shelter
 wall' hardly esteemed happy him, least
 world. still maintains true attitude moral action. let man
 duty first, without asking whether happy not,
 happiness inseparable accident attends him. 'seek ye
 first kingdom god righteousness, things
 shall added unto you.'

 secondly, may remarked plato preserves genuine character
 greek thought beginning state going
 individual. first ethics, politics--this order ideas
 us; reverse order history. many struggles
 thought individual assert right moral being. early
 ages one, one many, citizen state
 prior him; notion good evil apart law
 country creed church. type
 constantly tending revert, whenever influence custom,
 party spirit, recollection past becomes strong
 him.

 thirdly, may observe confusion identification
 individual state, ethics politics, pervades early
 greek speculation, even modern times retains certain degree
 influence. subtle difference collective individual
 action mankind seems escaped early thinkers,
 sometimes danger forgetting conditions united human action,
 whenever either elevate politics ethics, lower ethics
 standard politics. good man good citizen coincide
 perfect state; perfection cannot attained legislation
 acting upon without, but, all, education fashioning
 within.

 ...socrates praises sons ariston, 'inspired offspring
 renowned hero,' elegiac poet terms them;
 understand argue eloquently behalf injustice
 character shows uninfluenced arguments.

 division labour different employments; wholesale

 order give clearness conception state, plato
 proceeds trace first principles mutual need division
 labour imaginary community four five citizens. gradually
 community increases; division labour extends countries;
 imports necessitate exports; medium exchange required,
 retailers sit market-place save time producers.
 steps plato constructs first primitive

 several interesting remarks modern times would place

 plato: especially laws, population; free trade; adulteration; wills
 bequests; begging; eryxias, (though plato's), value demand;
 republic, division labour. last subject, also origin

 never seems recognized trade one great motive
 powers state world. would make retail traders
 inferior sort citizens (rep., laws), though remarks,
 quaintly enough (laws), 'if best men best women
 everywhere compelled keep taverns time carry
 retail trade, etc., knew pleasant agreeable
 things are.'

 disappointment glaucon 'city pigs,' ludicrous
 description ministers luxury refined state,
 afterthought necessity doctors, illustration
 nature guardian taken dog, desirableness
 offering almost unprocurable victim impure mysteries
 celebrated, behaviour zeus father hephaestus
 mother, touches humour also serious meaning.
 speaking education plato rather startles us affirming child
 must trained falsehood first truth afterwards. yet
 different saying children must taught
 medium imagination well reason; minds
 develope gradually, much must learn without
 understanding. also substance plato's view, though
 must acknowledged drawn line somewhat differently
 modern ethical writers, respecting truth falsehood. us, economies
 accommodations would allowable unless required
 human faculties necessary communication knowledge
 simple ignorant. insist word inseparable
 intention, must 'falsely true,' i.e. speak
 act falsely support right true. plato would
 limit use fictions requiring good
 moral effect, dangerous weapon falsehood
 employed rulers alone great objects.

 greek age plato attached importance question
 whether religion historical fact. beginning
 conscious past history; could see nothing beyond
 homer hesiod. whether narratives true false
 seriously affect political social life hellas. men began
 suspect fictions recognised
 immoral. religions: consideration morality
 comes first, afterwards truth documents
 recorded, events natural supernatural told
 them. modern times, protestant countries perhaps
 catholic, much inclined identify historical
 moral; refused believe religion all,
 unless superhuman accuracy discernible every part
 record. facts ancient religious history amongst
 important facts; frequently uncertain,
 learn true lesson gathered
 place them. reflections tend show
 difference plato ourselves, though unimportant,
 great might first sight appear. agree
 placing moral historical truth religion; and,
 generally, disregarding errors misstatements fact
 necessarily occur early stages religions. know also
 changes traditions country cannot made day;
 therefore tolerant many things science criticism would
 condemn.

 note passing allegorical interpretation mythology,
 said first introduced early sixth century
 christ theagenes rhegium, well established age
 plato, here, phaedrus, though different reason,
 rejected him. anachronisms whether religion law,
 men reached another stage civilization, got rid
 fictions accordance universal experience. great art
 interpretation; natural process, discovered
 always going on, could altered explained away.
 without palpable inconsistency existed side side two forms
 religion, tradition inherited invented poets
 customary worship temple; hand,
 religion philosopher, dwelling heaven ideas,
 therefore refuse offer cock aesculapius,
 seen saying prayers rising sun. length
 antagonism popular philosophical religion, never
 great among greeks age, disappeared, felt
 like difference religion educated uneducated
 among ourselves. zeus homer hesiod easily passed
 'royal mind' plato (philebus); giant heracles became
 knight-errant benefactor mankind. still wonderful
 transformations readily effected ingenuity stoics
 neo-platonists two three centuries christ.
 greek roman religions gradually permeated spirit
 philosophy; lost ancient meaning, resolved
 poetry morality; probably never purer time
 decay, influence world waning.

 singular conception occurs towards end book
 lie soul; connected platonic socratic
 doctrine involuntary ignorance worse voluntary. lie
 soul true lie, corruption highest truth,
 deception highest part soul, deceived
 power delivering himself. example, represent god

 protagoras 'knowledge sensation,' 'being becoming,'
 thrasymachus 'that might right,' would regarded

 play poem, allegory figure speech, sort
 accommodation,--which though useless gods may useful men

 raised propriety deceiving madman; also
 contrasting nature god man. god truth, mankind
 true appearing sometimes partial, false. reserving
 another place greater questions religion education,
 may note further, (1) approval old traditional education
 greece; (2) preparation plato making attack
 homer poets; (3) preparation also making
 use economies state; (4) contemptuous time
 euphemistic manner alludes 'chronique
 scandaleuse' gods.

 book iii. another motive purifying religion,
 banish fear; man courageous afraid death,
 believes tales repeated poets concerning world
 below. must gently requested abuse hell; may
 reminded stories untrue discouraging. must
 angry expunge obnoxious passages, depressing
 words achilles--'i would rather serving-man rule
 dead;' verses tell squalid mansions,
 senseless shadows, flitting soul mourning lost strength
 youth, soul gibber going beneath earth like smoke,
 souls suitors flutter like bats. terrors
 horrors cocytus styx, ghosts sapless shades, rest
 tartarean nomenclature, must vanish. tales may
 use; proper food soldiers. little
 admit sorrows sympathies homeric heroes:--achilles,
 son thetis, tears, throwing ashes head, pacing
 sea-shore distraction; priam, cousin gods,
 crying aloud, rolling mire. good man prostrated
 loss children fortune. neither death terrible him;
 therefore lamentations dead practised men
 note; concern inferior persons only, whether women
 men. still worse attribution weakness gods;
 goddesses say, 'alas! travail!' worst all,
 king heaven laments inability save hector, sorrows
 impending doom dear sarpedon. character god,
 ridiculed young men, likely imitated them.
 citizens given excess laughter--'such violent
 delights' followed violent re-action. description
 iliad gods shaking sides clumsiness hephaestus
 admitted us. 'certainly not.'

 truth high place among virtues, falsehood,
 saying, useless gods, useful men
 medicine. employment falsehood must remain privilege
 state; common man must return tell lie ruler;
 patient would tell lie physician, sailor
 captain.

 next place youth must temperate, temperance consists
 self-control obedience authority. lesson homer
 teaches places: 'the achaeans marched breathing prowess,
 silent awe leaders;'--but different one places:
 'o heavy wine, hast eyes dog, heart
 stag.' language latter kind impress self-control
 minds youth. may said praises eating
 drinking dread starvation; also verses
 tells rapturous loves zeus here, hephaestus
 detained ares aphrodite net similar occasion.
 nobler strain heard words:--'endure, soul, thou hast endured
 worse.' must allow citizens receive bribes, say,
 'gifts persuade gods, gifts reverend kings;' applaud
 ignoble advice phoenix achilles get money
 greeks assisted them; meanness achilles
 taking gifts agamemnon; requiring ransom body
 hector; cursing apollo; insolence river-god
 scamander; dedication dead patroclus hair
 already dedicated river-god spercheius;
 cruelty dragging body hector round walls, slaying
 captives pyre: combination meanness cruelty
 cheiron's pupil inconceivable. amatory exploits peirithous
 theseus equally unworthy. either so-called sons gods
 sons gods, poets imagine them,
 gods authors evil. youth
 believes things done blood heaven
 flowing veins ready imitate example.

 enough gods heroes;--what shall say men? poets
 story-tellers say--that wicked prosper righteous
 afflicted, justice another's gain? misrepresentations
 cannot allowed us. anticipating definition
 justice, therefore better defer enquiry.

 subjects poetry sufficiently treated; next follows
 style. poetry narrative events past, present,
 come; narrative three kinds, simple, imitative,
 composition two. instance make meaning clear.
 first scene homer last mixed kind, partly
 description partly dialogue. throw dialogue
 'oratio obliqua,' passage run thus: priest came prayed
 apollo achaeans might take troy safe return
 agamemnon would give back daughter; greeks
 assented, agamemnon wroth, on--the whole becomes
 descriptive, poet speaker left; or, omit
 narrative, whole becomes dialogue. three styles--which
 admitted state? 'do ask whether tragedy
 comedy admitted?' yes, also something more--is
 doubtful whether guardians imitators all? rather,
 question already answered, decided one
 man cannot life play many parts, act
 tragedy comedy, rhapsodist actor once? human nature
 coined small pieces, guardians
 business already, care freedom, enough
 without imitating. imitate imitate,
 meanness baseness, good only; mask actor
 wears apt become face. cannot allow men play parts
 women, quarrelling, weeping, scolding, boasting
 gods,--least making love labour. must
 represent slaves, bullies, cowards, drunkards, madmen,
 blacksmiths, neighing horses, bellowing bulls, sounding rivers,
 raging sea. good wise man willing perform good
 wise actions, ashamed play inferior part
 never practised; prefer employ descriptive style
 little imitation possible. man self-respect,
 contrary, imitate anybody anything; sounds nature
 cries animals alike; whole performance imitation
 gesture voice. descriptive style changes,
 dramatic great many. poets musicians use

 youth teachers well vulgar. state
 one man plays one part adapted complexity.

 original models (laws).

 next music. song ode three parts,--the subject,
 harmony, rhythm; two last dependent upon
 first. banished strains lamentation, may banish
 mixed lydian harmonies, harmonies lamentation;
 citizens temperate, may also banish convivial
 harmonies, ionian pure lydian. two remain--the

 religious ethical aspect plato's education hereafter
 considered separate head. lesser points may
 conveniently noticed place.

 1. constant appeal authority homer, whom, grave
 irony, plato, manner age, summons witness
 ethics psychology, well diet medicine; attempting
 distinguish better lesson worse, sometimes altering
 text design; quoting alluding homer
 inaccurately, manner early logographers turning
 iliad prose, delighting draw far-fetched inferences
 words, make ludicrous applications them. not, like
 heracleitus, get rage homer archilochus (heracl.),
 uses words expressions vehicles higher truth;
 system like theagenes rhegium metrodorus, later times
 stoics, fancy may dictate. conclusions drawn
 sound, although premises fictitious. fanciful appeals
 homer add charm plato's style, time
 effect satire follies homeric interpretation. us
 (and probably himself), although take form arguments,
 really figures speech. may compared modern
 citations scripture, often great rhetorical power even
 original meaning words entirely lost sight of.
 real, like platonic socrates, gather memorabilia
 xenophon, fond making similar adaptations. great ages
 countries, religion well law literature,
 art interpretation.

 2. 'the style conform subject metre style.'
 notwithstanding fascination word 'classical' exercises
 us, hardly maintain rule observed
 greek poetry come us. cannot deny thought
 often exceeds power lucid expression aeschylus pindar;
 rhetoric gets better thought sophist-poet
 euripides. perhaps sophocles perfect harmony
 two; alone find grace language like beauty
 greek statue, nothing add take away;
 least true single plays large portions them.
 connection tragic choruses greek lyric poets
 unfrequently tangled thread age logic poet
 unable draw out. many thoughts feelings mingled mind,
 power disengaging arranging them. subtle
 influence logic requires transferred prose
 poetry, music perfection language infused
 poetry prose. ages poet bad judge
 meaning (apol.); see word full
 associations mind difficult unmeaning
 another; sequence clear puzzling
 others. many passages greatest modern poets
 far obscure; proportion style
 subject, half-expressed figure, harsh construction,
 distorted collocation words, remote sequence ideas
 admitted; voice 'coming sweetly nature,' music
 adding expression feeling thought. could poetry
 without beauty, beauty without ease clearness. obscurities
 early greek poets arose necessarily state language
 logic existed age. examples followed
 us; use language ought every generation become
 clearer clearer. like shakespere, great spite,
 consequence, imperfections expression.
 reason returning necessary obscurity prevailed
 infancy literature. english poets last century
 certainly obscure; excuse losing
 gained, going back earlier transitional age
 preceded them. thought times out-stripped
 language; want plato's 'art measuring' rule cause
 disproportion them.

 3. third book republic nearer approach made
 theory art anywhere else plato. views may summed
 follows:--true art fanciful imitative, simple
 ideal,--the expression highest moral energy, whether action
 repose. live among works plastic art noble
 simple character, listen strains, best
 influences,--the true greek atmosphere, youth brought
 up. way create natural good taste,
 feeling truth beauty things. though
 poets expelled, still art recognized another aspect
 reason--like love symposium, extending sphere,
 confined preliminary education, acting power
 habit; conception art limited strains music
 forms plastic art, pervades nature wide kindred
 world. republic plato, like athens pericles,
 artistic well political side.

 hardly mention plato creative arts; two
 three passages even allude (rep.; soph.).
 lost rapture great works phidias, parthenon,
 propylea, statues zeus athene. would probably regarded
 abstract truth number figure higher greatest
 them. yet hard suppose influence, hopes
 inspire youth, pass mind works art
 saw around him. living upon fragments them,
 find broken stones standard truth beauty.
 plato feeling expression; nowhere says beauty
 object art; seems deny wisdom take external form
 (phaedrus); distinguish fine mechanical arts.
 whether no, like writers, felt expressed,
 rate remarkable greatest perfection fine arts
 coincide almost entire silence them. one
 striking passage tells us work art, like state,
 whole; conception whole love newly-born
 mathematical sciences may regarded, inspiring,
 rate regulating principles greek art (xen. mem.; sophist).

 4. plato makes true subtle remark physician better
 robust health; known illness
 person. judge ought similar experience
 evil; good man who, passed youth innocence,
 became acquainted late life vices others. therefore,
 according plato, judge young, young man
 according aristotle fit hearer moral philosophy.
 bad, hand, knowledge vice, knowledge
 virtue. may doubted, however, whether train reflection
 well founded. remarkable passage laws acknowledged
 evil may form correct estimate good. union
 gentleness courage book ii. first seemed paradox,
 yet afterwards ascertained truth. plato might also
 found intuition evil may consistent abhorrence
 it. directness aim virtue gives insight
 vice. knowledge character degree natural
 sense independent special experience good evil.

 5. one remarkable conceptions plato, un-greek
 also different anything existed age
 world, transposition ranks. spartan state
 enfranchisement helots degradation citizens
 special circumstances. ancient greek aristocracies, merit
 certainly recognized one elements government
 based. founders states supposed benefactors,
 raised great actions ordinary level humanity;
 later period, services warriors legislators held
 entitle descendants privileges citizenship
 first rank state. although existence ideal
 aristocracy slenderly proven remains early greek history,
 difficulty ascribing character, however idea
 may defined, actual hellenic state--or indeed state
 ever existed world--still rule best
 certainly aspiration philosophers, probably accommodated
 good deal views primitive history notions good
 government. plato insists applying guardians
 state series tests fell short fixed
 standard either removed governing body, admitted
 it; 'academic' discipline certain extent prevail
 greek states, especially sparta. also indicates system
 caste, existed great part ancient, means
 extinct modern european world, set aside time
 time favour merit. aware deeply greater part
 mankind resent interference order society, therefore
 proposes novel idea form calls
 'monstrous fiction.' (compare ceremony preparation two
 'great waves' book v.) two principles indicated him: first,
 distinction ranks dependent circumstances prior
 individual: second, distinction ought broken
 personal qualities. adapts mythology like homeric
 poems wants state, making 'the phoenician tale'
 vehicle ideas. every greek state myth respecting
 origin; platonic republic may also tale earthborn men.
 gravity verisimilitude tale told, analogy
 greek tradition, sufficient verification 'monstrous
 falsehood.' ancient poetry spoken gold silver brass
 iron age succeeding one another, plato supposes differences
 natures men exist together single state. mythology
 supplies figure lesson may taught (as protagoras
 says, 'the myth interesting'), also enables plato touch
 lightly new principles without going details. passage
 shadows forth general truth, tell us steps
 transposition ranks effected. indeed throughout republic
 allows lower ranks fade distance. know
 whether carry arms, whether fifth book
 included communistic regulations respecting property
 marriage. use arguing strictly either
 chance words, silence plato, drawing inferences
 beyond vision. aristotle, criticism
 position lower classes, perceive poetical
 creation 'like air, invulnerable,' cannot penetrated
 shafts logic (pol.).

 6. two paradoxes strike modern reader highest degree
 fanciful ideal, suggest many reflections,
 found third book republic: first, great power
 music, much beyond influence experienced us modern
 times, art science far developed,
 found secret harmony, well melody; secondly,
 indefinite almost absolute control soul supposed
 exercise body.

 first suspect degree exaggeration, may
 also observe among certain masters art, unknown us,
 present day. natural enthusiasm, felt only,
 seems mingle plato sort pythagorean reverence
 numbers numerical proportion aristotle stranger.
 intervals sound number sacred things law
 own, dependent variations sense. rise
 sense, become connecting link world ideas.
 evident plato describing appears also fact.
 power simple characteristic melody impressible
 mind greek easily appreciate. effect
 national airs may bear comparison it. and, besides this,
 confusion harmony musical notes
 harmony soul body, potently inspired them.

 second paradox leads curious interesting
 questions--how far mind control body? relation
 one mutual antagonism mutual harmony?
 two one, either cause other? may
 times drop opposition them, mode describing them,
 familiar us, yet hardly conveys precise meaning,
 try view composite creature, man, simple manner?
 must rate admit human nature higher
 lower principle, divided distinct line, times
 break asunder take arms one another? again,
 reconciled move together, either unconsciously ordinary work
 life, consciously pursuit noble aim, attained
 without effort, every thought nerve
 strained. body becomes good friend ally, servant
 instrument mind. mind often wonderful almost
 superhuman power banishing disease weakness calling
 hidden strength. reason desires, intellect senses
 brought harmony obedience form single human
 being. ever parting, ever meeting; identity
 diversity tendencies operations part
 unnoticed us. mind touches body appetites,
 acknowledge responsibility one other.
 tendency us says 'drink.' another says, 'do
 drink; good you.' us know
 rightful superior. also responsible health, although
 sphere enter elements necessity may beyond
 control. still even management health, care thought,
 continued many years, may make us almost free agents,
 exact much ourselves, acknowledge human
 freedom limited laws nature mind.

 disappointed find plato, general condemnation
 passes practice medicine prevailing day,
 depreciates effects diet. would like diseases

 afraid invalidism interfering business life.
 recognize time great healer mental bodily
 disorders; remedies gradual proceed little
 little safer produce sudden catastrophe. neither

 action occasion human life higher freedom
 simple truly asserted.

 7. lesser matters style may remarked.

 passing lightly subject.

 book iv. adeimantus said: 'suppose person argue, socrates,

 may get without cobblers; guardians degenerate boon

 middle condition best artisans; money enough
 buy tools, enough independent business.
 condition best citizens? poor,

 education remains established form,
 danger. restorative process always going on; spirit law
 order raise fallen down. regulations
 needed lesser matters life--rules deportment
 fashions dress. like invites like good evil. education
 correct deficiencies supply power self-government. far
 us enter particulars legislation; let
 guardians take care education, education take care
 things.

 without education may patch mend please;

 favourite remedy give luxurious mode living.
 tell persons must first alter habits,
 grow angry; charming people. 'charming,--nay,

 state like them. states first ordain

 six feet high, measure, believe anything
 else? get passion: see statesmen trying
 nostrums, fancying cut blow hydra-like
 rogueries mankind, good play. minute enactments
 superfluous good states, useless bad ones.

 remains work legislation? nothing us;
 apollo god delphi leave ordering greatest
 things--that say, religion. ancestral deity sitting upon
 centre navel earth trusted us
 sense, affair magnitude. foreign god shall supreme
 realms...

 here, socrates would say, let us 'reflect on' (greek)
 preceded: thus far spoken happiness citizens,
 well-being state. may happiest
 men, principal aim founding state make
 happy. guardians, holiday-makers. pleasant
 manner presented us famous question ancient modern
 philosophy, touching relation duty happiness, right
 utility.

 first duty, happiness, natural order moral ideas.
 utilitarian principle valuable corrective error, shows
 us side ethics apt neglected. may admitted
 right utility co-extensive, makes
 happiness mankind object one highest noblest
 motives human action. utility historical basis
 morality; aspect moral religious ideas commonly
 occur mind. greatest happiness is, believe,
 far-off result divine government universe. greatest
 happiness individual certainly found life virtue
 goodness. seem assured law right
 divine purpose, 'all mankind saved;'
 infer one other. greatest happiness
 individual may reverse greatest happiness ordinary
 sense term, may realised life pain,
 voluntary death. further, word 'happiness' several ambiguities;
 may mean either pleasure ideal life, happiness subjective
 objective, world another,
 neighbours men everywhere. modern founder
 utilitarianism self-regarding disinterested motives action
 included term, although commonly opposed
 us benevolence self-love. word happiness
 definiteness sacredness 'truth' 'right';
 equally appeal higher nature, sunk
 conscience mankind. associated much comforts
 conveniences life; little 'the goods soul
 desire sake.' great trial, danger, temptation,
 great heroic action, scarcely thought of.
 reasons 'the greatest happiness' principle true foundation
 ethics. though first principle, second,
 like unto it, often easier application. larger part
 human actions neither right wrong, except far tend
 happiness mankind (introd. gorgias philebus).

 question reappears politics, useful expedient
 seems claim larger sphere greater authority.
 concerning political measures, chiefly ask: affect
 happiness mankind? yet may observe term
 expediency merely law right limited conditions human
 society. right truth highest aims government well
 individuals; ought lose sight cannot
 directly enforce them. appeal better mind nations;
 sometimes much merely temporal interests resist.
 watchwords men use matters public policy,
 well private dealings; peace europe may said
 depend upon them. commercial utilitarian states
 society power ideas remains. higher class
 statesmen something idealism pericles said
 gathered teaching anaxagoras. recognise
 true leader men must motives ambition,
 national character greater value material comfort
 prosperity. order thought plato; first, expects
 citizens duty, favourable circumstances,
 say, well-ordered state, happiness assured.
 far excluding modern principle utility
 politics sufficiently evident passages; 'the
 beneficial affirmed honourable', also 'the
 sacred'.

 may note

 (1) manner objection adeimantus here, designed
 draw deepen argument socrates.

 (2) conception whole lying foundation
 politics art, latter supplying principle
 criticism, which, various names harmony, symmetry, measure,
 proportion, unity, greek seems applied works art.

 (3) requirement state limited size,
 traditional model greek state; politics aristotle,
 fact cities hellas small converted principle.

 (4) humorous pictures lean dogs fatted sheep,
 light active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen least,
 'charming' patients always making worse; again,
 playful assumption state own; grave
 irony statesman excused believes six
 feet high told so, nothing measure
 pardoned ignorance--he amusing us
 seriously angry him.

 (5) light superficial manner religion passed
 provision made two great principles,--first,
 religion shall based highest conception gods, secondly,
 true national hellenic type shall maintained...

 socrates proceeds: amid justice? son ariston,
 tell where. light candle search city, get brother
 rest friends help seeking her. 'that do,'
 replied glaucon, 'you promised make search talked
 impiety deserting justice.' well, said, lead
 way, follow. notion is, state perfect
 contain four virtues--wisdom, courage, temperance, justice.
 eliminate three first, unknown remainder justice.

 first then, wisdom: state called
 wise politic. policy one among many kinds skill,--not
 skill carpenter, worker metal,
 husbandman, skill advises interests
 whole state. kind skill guardians,
 small class number, far smaller blacksmiths;
 concentrated wisdom state. small ruling class
 wisdom, whole state wise.

 second virtue courage, difficulty finding
 another class--that soldiers. courage may defined sort
 salvation--the never-failing salvation opinions law
 education prescribed concerning dangers. know way
 dyers first prepare white ground lay dye purple

 call 'courage,' adding epithet 'political' 'civilized'
 order distinguish mere animal courage higher
 courage may hereafter discussed.

 two virtues remain; temperance justice. preceding
 virtues temperance suggests idea harmony. light thrown
 upon nature virtue popular description man
 'master himself'--which absurd sound, master
 also servant. expression really means better principle
 man masters worse. cities whole classes--women,
 slaves like--who correspond worse,
 better; state former class held control
 latter. classes temperance belong? 'to

 right describing virtue harmony diffused

 attuning upper middle lower classes like strings

 socrates proceeds discover nature justice method
 residues. first three virtues corresponds one

 although third, temperance, nature harmony
 first two. fourth virtue, sought
 relation three parts soul classes state
 one another. obvious simple, reason
 found out. modern logician inclined object
 ideas cannot separated like chemical substances, run
 one another may different aspects names

 definition given justice verbally one
 definitions temperance given socrates charmides,
 however provisional, afterwards rejected. far
 justice remaining virtues eliminated,
 justice temperance republic difficulty
 distinguished. temperance appears virtue part only,
 one three, whereas justice universal virtue whole soul.
 yet hand temperance also described sort harmony,
 respect akin justice. justice seems differ
 temperance degree rather kind; whereas temperance
 harmony discordant elements, justice perfect order
 natures classes business, right man
 right place, division co-operation citizens. justice,
 again, abstract notion virtues, therefore,
 plato's point view, foundation them,
 referred idea precedes them. proposal omit
 temperance mere trick style intended avoid monotony.

 famous question discussed one earlier dialogues
 plato (protagoras; arist. nic. ethics), 'whether virtues one
 many?' receives answer effect
 four cardinal virtues (now first time brought together
 ethical philosophy), one supreme rest, like
 aristotle's conception universal justice, virtue relative others,
 whole virtue relative parts. universal
 conception justice order first education moral
 nature man, still universal conception good
 second education sphere speculative knowledge seems
 succeed. might equally described terms 'law,' 'order,'
 'harmony;' idea good embraces 'all time
 existence,' conception justice extended beyond man.

 ...socrates going identify individual state.
 first must prove three parts individual soul.
 argument follows:--quantity makes difference quality.
 word 'just,' whether applied individual state,
 meaning. term 'justice' implied three
 principles state individual
 business. really three one? question difficult,
 one hardly solved methods
 using; truer longer way would take much time.
 'the shorter satisfy me.' well then, would admit
 qualities states mean qualities individuals compose
 them? scythians thracians passionate, race
 intellectual, egyptians phoenicians covetous,
 individual members character;
 difficulty determine whether several principles one
 three; whether, say, reason one part nature,
 desire another, angry another, whether whole soul
 comes play sort action. enquiry, however, requires
 exact definition terms. thing relation
 cannot affected two opposite ways. impossibility
 man standing still, yet moving arms, top fixed
 one spot going round upon axis. necessity mention
 possible exceptions; let us provisionally assume opposites
 cannot suffer opposites relation.
 class opposites belong assent dissent, desire avoidance.
 one form desire thirst hunger: arises new
 point--thirst thirst drink, hunger hunger food; warm
 drink particular kind food, single exception
 course fact desiring anything implies
 good. relative terms attributes, correlatives
 attributes; attributes, correlatives also
 them. example, term 'greater' simply relative 'less,'
 knowledge refers subject knowledge. hand,
 particular knowledge particular subject. again, every science
 distinct character, defined object; medicine,
 example, science health, although confounded
 health. cleared ideas thus far, let us return original
 instance thirst, definite object--drink. thirsty
 soul may feel two distinct impulses; animal one saying 'drink;'
 rational one, says 'do drink.' two impulses
 contradictory; therefore may assume spring
 distinct principles soul. passion third principle,
 akin desire? story certain leontius throws
 light question. coming piraeus outside
 north wall, passed spot dead bodies lying
 executioner. felt longing desire see also
 abhorrence them; first turned away shut eyes, then,
 suddenly tearing open, said,--'take fill, ye wretches,
 fair sight.' third principle often
 found come assistance reason desire, never
 desire reason? passion spirit, separate
 existence may convince putting
 following case:--when man suffers justly, generous
 nature indignant hardships undergoes:
 suffers unjustly, indignation great support; hunger
 thirst cannot tame him; spirit within must die,
 voice shepherd, is, reason, bidding dog bark
 more, heard within. shows passion ally reason.
 passion reason? no, former exists children
 brutes; homer affords proof distinction
 says, 'he smote breast, thus rebuked soul.'

 now, last, reached firm ground, able infer
 virtues state individual same.
 wisdom courage justice state severally wisdom
 courage justice individuals form state.
 three classes work class state,
 part individual soul; reason, superior, passion,
 inferior, harmonized influence music gymnastic.
 counsellor warrior, head arm, act together
 town mansoul, keep desires proper subjection.
 courage warrior quality preserves right opinion
 dangers spite pleasures pains. wisdom
 counsellor small part soul authority
 reason. virtue temperance friendship ruling
 subject principles, state individual. justice
 already spoken; notion already given may
 confirmed common instances. state
 individual steal, lie, commit adultery, guilty impiety
 gods men? 'no.' reason several
 principles, whether state individual,
 business? justice quality makes men
 states. moreover, old division labour, required
 one man one use, dream anticipation
 follow; dream realized justice,
 begins binding together three chords soul, acts
 harmoniously every relation life. injustice,
 insubordination disobedience inferior elements soul,
 opposite justice, inharmonious unnatural,
 soul disease body; soul well
 body, good bad actions produce good bad habits. virtue
 health beauty well-being soul, vice disease
 weakness deformity soul.

 old question returns upon us: justice injustice
 profitable? question become ridiculous. injustice, like
 mortal disease, makes life worth having. come hill
 overhangs city look upon single form virtue,
 infinite forms vice, among four special ones,
 characteristic states individuals. state
 corresponds single form virtue
 describing, wherein reason rules one two names--monarchy
 aristocracy. thus five forms all, states
 souls...

 attempting prove soul three separate faculties, plato
 takes occasion discuss makes difference faculties.
 criterion proposes difference working
 faculties. faculty cannot produce contradictory effects.
 path early reasoners beset thorny entanglements,
 proceed step without first clearing ground. leads

 necessary clearing ideas first

 psychology plato extends division soul
 rational, irascible, concupiscent elements, which, far
 know, first made him, retained aristotle
 succeeding ethical writers. chief difficulty early
 analysis mind define exactly place irascible
 faculty (greek), may variously described terms
 righteous indignation, spirit, passion. foundation courage,
 includes plato moral courage, courage enduring pain,
 surmounting intellectual difficulties, well meeting dangers
 war. though irrational, inclines side rational:
 cannot aroused punishment justly inflicted: sometimes
 takes form enthusiasm sustains man performance
 great actions. 'lion heart' reason makes
 treaty. hand negative rather positive;
 indignant wrong falsehood, not, like love
 symposium phaedrus, aspire vision truth good.
 peremptory military spirit prevails government honour.
 differs anger (greek), latter term accessory
 notion righteous indignation. although aristotle retained
 word, yet may observe 'passion' (greek) lost
 affinity rational become indistinguishable 'anger'
 (greek). vernacular use plato laws seems
 revert, though always. modern philosophy too, well
 ordinary conversation, words anger passion employed almost
 exclusively bad sense; connotation
 reasonable cause aroused. feeling 'righteous
 indignation' partial accidental admit regarding
 separate virtue habit. tempted also doubt whether
 plato right supposing offender, however justly condemned,
 could expected acknowledge justice sentence;
 spirit philosopher martyr rather criminal.

 may observe nearly plato approaches aristotle's famous thesis,
 'good actions produce good habits.' words 'as healthy practices
 (greek) produce health, practices produce justice,'
 sound like nicomachean ethics. note also
 incidental remark plato become far-reaching principle
 aristotle, inseparable part great ethical system.

 difficulty understanding plato meant 'the longer
 way': seems intimate metaphysic future

 glaucon, laughing, 'in case murder us acquit

 socrates proceeds:--the guardians state watch-dogs,
 already said. dogs divided hes shes--we

 first question is, whether women able either wholly partially

 division labour; diversity employments based
 difference natures. difference men

 glaucon, made unwilling speak family relations. however,

 argument is, different natures different uses,
 natures men women said differ. verbal
 opposition. consider difference may purely nominal
 accidental; example, bald man hairy man opposed
 single point view, cannot infer bald man
 cobbler hairy man ought cobbler.
 inference erroneous? simply opposition
 partial only, like difference male physician female
 physician, running whole nature, like difference
 physician carpenter. difference sexes
 one beget bear children,
 prove ought distinct educations. admitting women
 differ men capacity, men equally differ one another?
 nature scattered qualities citizens require
 indifferently among two sexes? even
 peculiar pursuits, women often, though cases superior
 men, ridiculously enough surpassed them? women kind
 men, aptitude want aptitude medicine
 gymnastic war, less degree. one woman good
 guardian, another not; good must chosen colleagues

 let strip, clothed chastity, share toils war

 first wave past, argument compelled admit men

 possibility. 'nay, think considerable doubt entertained

 first place rulers enforce laws make new ones

 avoid prohibited degrees parents children,
 brothers sisters, last, however, absolutely

 socrates proceeds: prove scheme advantageous

 unity; greatest evil, discord distraction.
 unity private pleasures pains interests--where
 one member suffers members suffer, one citizen touched

 state runs whole body vibrates soul.
 true state, like individual, injured whole part
 affected. every state subjects rulers, democracy
 called rulers, states masters: state
 called saviours allies; subjects states

 fathers brothers. whereas states members
 government regard one colleagues friend another
 enemy, state man stranger another; every citizen
 connected every ties blood, names
 way speaking corresponding reality--brother, father,
 sister, mother, repeated infancy ears children,

 common property common pleasures pains.

 strife contention among one mind;
 lawsuits property men nothing bodies

 younger man strike elder; reverence prevent

 parents themselves, animals, sight
 young ones prove great incentive bravery. young warriors must

 philosophy deserted natural protectors, others enter
 dishonour her. vulgar little minds see land open rush

 real difficulty, dialectic. later, perhaps, occasionally
 go lecture philosophy. years advance, sun philosophy,
 unlike heracleitus, sets never rise again. order
 education reversed; begin gymnastics youth,

 like socrates, may recapitulate virtues philosopher.
 language seems reach beyond horizon age
 country, described 'the spectator time
 existence.' noblest gifts nature, makes highest
 use them. desires absorbed love wisdom,
 love truth. none graces beautiful soul wanting

 ideal modern times hardly retains simplicity antique;
 originality either truth error
 characterized greeks. philosopher longer living
 unseen, sent oracle convince mankind ignorance;
 regard knowledge system ideas leading upwards
 regular stages idea good. eagerness pursuit
 abated; division labour less comprehensive
 reflection upon nature human life whole; exact
 observation less anticipation inspiration. still,
 altered conditions knowledge, parallel wholly lost;
 may use translating conception plato
 language age. philosopher modern times one
 fixes mind laws nature sequence connexion,
 fragments pictures nature; history, controversy;
 truths acknowledged few, opinions
 many. aware importance 'classifying according
 nature,' try 'separate limbs science without breaking
 them' (phaedr.). part truth, whether great small,
 dishonour; least things discern
 greatest (parmen.). like ancient philosopher sees world
 pervaded analogies, also tell 'why cases single
 instance sufficient induction' (mill's logic),
 cases thousand examples would prove nothing. inquires

 varieties knowledge type mathematics. must
 nobility character, without genius loses better half
 greatness. regarding world point immensity,
 individual link never-ending chain existence,
 think much life, greatly afraid death.

 adeimantus objects first form socratic reasoning,
 thus showing plato aware imperfection method.
 brings accusation might brought
 modern logician--that extracts answer knows
 put question. long argument words apt change
 meaning slightly, premises may assumed conclusions
 inferred rather much certainty universality; variation
 step may unobserved, yet last divergence becomes
 considerable. hence failure attempts apply arithmetical
 algebraic formulae logic. imperfection, rather higher
 elastic nature language, allow words
 precision numbers symbols. quality language impairs
 force argument many steps.

 objection, though fairly met socrates particular
 instance, may regarded implying reflection upon socratic
 mode reasoning. here, elsewhere, plato seems intimate
 time come negative interrogative method socrates
 must superseded positive constructive one, examples
 given later dialogues. adeimantus argues
 ideal wholly variance facts; experience proves
 philosophers either useless rogues. contrary expectation
 socrates hesitation admitting truth this, explains
 anomaly allegory, first characteristically depreciating
 inventive powers. allegory people distinguished
 professional politicians, and, elsewhere, spoken tone
 pity rather censure image 'the noble captain
 quick perceptions.'

 uselessness philosophers explained circumstance
 mankind use them. world ages divided
 contempt fear employ power ideas
 know weapons. concerning false philosopher, socrates argues
 best liable corruption; finer nature
 likely suffer alien conditions. observe
 kinds excellence spring peculiar delicacy
 constitution; evidently true poetical imaginative
 temperament, often seems depend impressions, hence
 breathe live certain atmosphere. man genius
 greater pains greater pleasures, greater powers greater
 weaknesses, often greater play character found
 ordinary men. assume disguise virtue disinterestedness
 without them, veil personal enmity language
 patriotism philosophy,--he say word men
 thinking, insight terrible follies
 weaknesses fellow-men. alcibiades, mirabeau, napoleon
 first, born either authors great evils states,
 'of great good, drawn direction.'

 yet thesis, 'corruptio optimi pessima,' cannot maintained
 generally without regard kind excellence
 corrupted. alien conditions corrupting one nature, may
 elements culture another. general man receive
 highest development congenial state family, among friends
 fellow-workers. also may sometimes stirred adverse
 circumstances degree rises reforms

 evil, say corrupt state church society, live
 happily, allowing evil remain, finer stronger natures may
 crushed spoiled surrounding influences--may become misanthrope
 philanthrope turns; instances, like founders
 monastic orders, reformers, owing peculiarity
 age, may break away entirely world
 church, sometimes great good, sometimes great evil,
 sometimes both. holds lesser sphere
 convent, school, family.

 plato would us consider easily best natures overpowered
 public opinion, efforts rest mankind make
 get possession them. world, church, profession,
 political party organization, always carrying legs
 teaching apply high holy names prejudices
 interests. 'monster' corporation belong judges
 right truth pleasure community. individual
 becomes one order; or, resists, world much

 one-sided wholly untrue picture maxims practice
 mankind 'sit together assembly,' either ancient
 modern times.

 higher natures corrupted politics, lower take
 possession vacant place philosophy. described one

 expression, 'veils herself,' dropped reappears

 also better mind many; would believe

 seem two great aims philosophy plato,--first,
 realize abstractions; secondly, connect them. according him,
 true education draws men becoming being,
 comprehensive survey being. desires develop human
 mind faculty seeing universal things; last
 particulars sense drop away universal alone remains.
 seeks combine universals disengaged sense,

 modern mathematician readily sympathise plato's delight

 power attention, developes sense order faculty
 construction, enables mind grasp simple formulae

 value education, sees also connexion
 higher moral intellectual ideas. attempt plato
 makes connect them, easily trace influences ancient
 pythagorean notions. reason suppose speaking
 ideal numbers; describing numbers pure
 abstractions, assigns real separate existence, which,
 'the teachers art' (meaning probably pythagoreans) would
 affirmed, repel attempts subdivision, unity

 two passages seem require particular explanations. first,

 question, 'what great, small?' thus begins

 ill-educated, yet fond literature, although
 speaker,--fierce slaves, obedient rulers, lover power
 honour, hopes gain deeds arms,--fond, too,
 gymnastics hunting. advances years grows avaricious,

 men. origin follows:--his father good man dwelling
 ill-ordered state, retired politics order may
 lead quiet life. mother angry loss precedence among
 women; disgusted husband's selfishness,
 expatiates son unmanliness indolence father.
 old family servant takes tale, says youth:--'when
 grow must man father.' world
 agreed minds business idiot,
 busybody highly honoured esteemed. young man compares
 spirit father's words ways, naturally well
 disposed, although suffered evil influences, rests
 middle point becomes ambitious lover honour.

 let us set another city another man. next form
 government oligarchy, rule rich only;
 difficult see state arises. decline begins
 possession gold silver; illegal modes expenditure
 invented; one draws another on, multitude infected; riches
 outweigh virtue; lovers money take place lovers honour;
 misers politicians; and, time, political privileges confined
 law rich, shrink violence order effect
 purposes.

 thus much origin,--let us next consider evils oligarchy.
 would man wanted safe voyage take bad pilot
 rich, refuse good one poor?
 analogy apply still state? yet greater evils:
 two nations struggling together one--the rich poor;
 rich dare put arms hands poor, unwilling
 pay defenders money. already
 condemned state persons warriors well
 shopkeepers? greatest evil man may sell
 property place state; one class
 enormous wealth, entirely destitute. observe
 destitutes really governing nature
 rich poor; miserable
 spendthrifts always. drones hive; whereas
 actual drone unprovided nature sting, two-legged things
 call drones without stings
 dreadful stings; words, paupers
 rogues. never far apart; oligarchical cities,
 nearly everybody pauper ruler, find abundance
 both. evil state society originates bad education
 bad government.

 like state, like man,--the change latter begins
 representative timocracy; walks first ways
 father, may statesman, general, perhaps;
 presently sees 'fallen high estate,' victim
 informers, dying prison exile, hand executioner.
 lesson thus receives, makes cautious; leaves
 politics, represses pride, saves pence. avarice enthroned
 bosom's lord, assumes style great king; rational
 spirited elements sit humbly ground either side, one
 immersed calculation, absorbed admiration
 wealth. love honour turns love money; conversion
 instantaneous. man mean, saving, toiling, slave one
 passion master rest: image
 state? education, would never allowed blind
 god riches lead dance within him. uneducated
 many slavish desires, beggarly, knavish, breeding
 soul. trustee orphan, power defraud,
 soon prove without will,
 passions restrained fear reason. hence leads
 divided existence; better desires mostly prevail.
 contending prizes distinctions, afraid
 incur loss repaid barren honour; time
 war fights small part resources, usually keeps
 money loses victory.

 next comes democracy democratic man, oligarchy
 oligarchical man. insatiable avarice ruling passion
 oligarchy; encourage expensive habits order may
 gain ruin extravagant youth. thus men family often lose
 property rights citizenship; remain city,
 full hatred new owners estates ripe
 revolution. usurer stooping walk pretends see them;
 passes by, leaves sting--that is, money--in
 victim; many man pay parent principal sum multiplied
 family children, reduced state dronage
 him. way diminishing evil either limit man
 use property, insist shall lend
 risk. ruling class want remedies; care
 money, careless virtue poorest citizens.
 occasions governors governed meet
 together,--at festivals, journey, voyaging fighting. sturdy
 pauper finds hour danger despised; sees
 rich man puffing panting, draws conclusion
 privately imparts companions,--'that people good
 much;' sickly frame made ill mere touch without,
 sometimes without external impulse ready fall pieces
 itself, least cause, none all, city falls ill
 fights battle life death. democracy comes power
 poor victors, killing exiling some, giving
 equal shares government rest.

 manner life state democrats;
 freedom plainness speech, every man right
 eyes, way life. hence arise various
 developments character; state like piece embroidery
 colours figures manners men, many
 who, like women children, prefer variety real beauty
 excellence. state one many, like bazaar
 buy anything. great charm is, may like;
 may govern like, let alone like; go war make
 peace feel disposed, quite irrespective anybody
 else. condemn men death remain alive same;
 gentleman desired go exile, stalks streets
 like hero; nobody sees cares him. observe, too,
 grandly democracy sets foot upon fine theories
 education,--how little cares training statesmen!
 qualification demands profession patriotism.
 democracy;--a pleasing, lawless, various sort government,
 distributing equality equals unequals alike.

 let us inspect individual democrat; first, case
 state, trace antecedents. son miserly
 oligarch, taught restrain love unnecessary
 pleasures. perhaps ought explain latter term:--necessary
 pleasures good, cannot without;
 unnecessary pleasures good,
 desire might eradicated early training. example, pleasures
 eating drinking necessary healthy, certain point;
 beyond point alike hurtful body mind,
 excess may avoided. excess, may rightly called
 expensive pleasures, opposition useful ones. drone,
 called him, slave unnecessary pleasures desires,
 whereas miserly oligarch subject necessary.

 oligarch changes democrat following manner:--the
 youth miserly bringing up, gets taste drone's
 honey; meets wild companions, introduce every new
 pleasure. state, individual, allies
 sides, temptations without passions within;
 reason also external influences parents friends alliance
 oligarchical principle; two factions violent
 conflict one another. sometimes party order prevails,
 new desires new disorders arise, whole mob
 passions gets possession acropolis, say, soul,
 find void unguarded true words works. falsehoods
 illusions ascend take place; prodigal goes back
 country lotophagi drones, openly dwells there.
 offer alliance parley individual elders comes home,
 false spirits shut gates castle permit one
 enter,--there battle, gain victory; straightway
 making alliance desires, banish modesty, call
 folly, send temperance border. house
 swept garnished, dress exiled vices, and, crowning
 garlands, bring back new names. insolence call good
 breeding, anarchy freedom, waste magnificence, impudence courage.
 process youth passes necessary pleasures
 unnecessary. divides time impartially
 them; perhaps, gets older violence passion
 abated, restores exiles lives sort
 equilibrium, indulging first one pleasure another;
 reason comes tells pleasures good honourable,
 others bad vile, shakes head says make
 distinction them. thus lives fancy hour;
 sometimes takes drink, turns abstainer; practises
 gymnasium nothing all; would
 philosopher politician; again, would warrior man
 business;

 'every thing starts nothing long.'

 remains still finest fairest men
 states--tyranny tyrant. tyranny springs democracy much
 democracy springs oligarchy. arise excess; one
 excess wealth, excess freedom. 'the great natural
 good life,' says democrat, 'is freedom.' exclusive love
 freedom regardlessness everything else, cause
 change democracy tyranny. state demands strong wine
 freedom, unless rulers give plentiful draught, punishes
 insults them; equality fraternity governors governed
 approved principle. anarchy law, state only,
 private houses, extends even animals. father son,
 citizen foreigner, teacher pupil, old young,
 level; fathers teachers fear sons pupils, wisdom
 young man match elder, old imitate
 jaunty manners young afraid thought
 morose. slaves level masters mistresses,
 difference men women. nay, animals
 democratic state freedom unknown places.
 she-dogs good she-mistresses, horses asses march
 along dignity run noses anybody comes
 way. 'that often experience.' last citizens
 become sensitive cannot endure yoke laws, written
 unwritten; would man call master.
 glorious beginning things tyranny springs. 'glorious,
 indeed; follow?' ruin oligarchy ruin
 democracy; law contraries; excess freedom
 passes excess slavery, greater freedom
 greater slavery. remember oligarchy found
 two classes--rogues paupers, compared drones
 without stings. two classes state phlegm bile
 human body; state-physician, legislator, must get
 rid them, bee-master keeps drones hive.
 democracy, too, drones, numerous
 dangerous oligarchy; inert
 unpractised, full life animation; keener
 sort speak act, others buzz bema prevent
 opponents heard. another class
 democratic states, respectable, thriving individuals,
 squeezed drones need possessions;
 moreover third class, labourers artisans,
 make mass people. people meet,
 omnipotent, cannot brought together unless
 attracted little honey; rich made supply honey,
 demagogues keep greater part themselves, giving taste
 mob. victims attempt resist; driven mad
 stings drones, become downright oligarchs
 self-defence. follow informations convictions treason.
 people protector nurse greatness,
 root tree tyranny springs. nature change indicated
 old fable temple zeus lycaeus, tells
 tastes human flesh mixed flesh victims turn
 wolf. even protector, tastes human blood, slays
 exiles others without law, hints abolition
 debts division lands, must either perish become wolf--that
 is, tyrant. perhaps driven out, soon comes back
 exile; enemies cannot get rid lawful means,
 plot assassination. thereupon friend people makes
 well-known request body-guard, readily
 grant, thinking danger own. let
 rich man make wings, never run away
 then. great protector, crushed
 rivals, stands proudly erect chariot state, full-blown
 tyrant: let us enquire nature happiness.

 early days tyranny smiles beams upon everybody;
 'dominus,' no, he: come put end debt
 monopoly land. got rid foreign enemies, makes
 necessary state always going war. thus
 enabled depress poor heavy taxes, keep work;
 get rid bolder spirits handing enemy.
 comes unpopularity; old associates courage
 oppose him. consequence is, make purgation
 state; but, unlike physician purges away bad, must get
 rid high-spirited, wise wealthy; choice
 death life shame dishonour. hated
 is, require trusty guards; obtain them?
 'they come flocking like birds--for pay.' rather obtain
 spot? take slaves owners make
 body-guard; trusted friends, admire
 look him. tragic poets wise magnify exalt
 tyrant, say wise association wise?
 praises tyranny alone sufficient reason
 exclude state? may go cities, gather
 mob fine words, change commonwealths tyrannies
 democracies, receiving honours rewards services;
 higher friends ascend constitution hill,
 honour fail become 'too asthmatic mount.' return
 tyrant--how support rare army his? first, robbing
 temples treasures, enable lighten
 taxes; take father's property, spend
 companions, male female. father demus,
 demus gets angry, says great hulking son ought
 burden parents, bids riotous crew begone,
 parent know monster nurturing,
 son would fain expel strong him. 'you mean
 say beat father?' yes, will, taken away
 arms. 'then parricide cruel, unnatural son.'
 people jumped fear slavery slavery,
 smoke fire. thus liberty, order reason,
 passes worst form servitude...

 previous books plato described ideal state;
 returns perverted declining forms, lightly
 touched end book iv. describes succession
 parallels individuals states, tracing origin
 either state individual preceded them. begins
 asking point digressed; thus led shortly
 recapitulate substance three former books, also contain
 parallel philosopher state.

 first decline gives intelligible account; would
 liked admit probable causes fall ideal state,
 us would appear impracticability communism
 natural antagonism ruling subject classes. throws
 veil mystery origin decline, attributes
 ignorance law population. law famous geometrical
 figure number expression. like ancients general,
 idea gradual perfectibility man education
 human race. ideal attained course ages,
 spring full armour head legislator. good
 laws given, thought manner
 likely corrupted, might filled detail
 restored accordance original spirit. appears
 reflected upon full meaning words, 'in brief
 space human life, nothing great accomplished'; again,
 afterwards says laws, 'infinite time maker cities.'
 order constitutions adopted represents order
 thought rather succession time, may considered
 first attempt frame philosophy history.

 first declining states timocracy, government
 soldiers lovers honour, answers spartan state;
 government force, education inspired
 muses, imposed law, finer elements
 organization disappeared. philosopher lost
 love truth, soldier, simpler honester nature,
 rules stead. individual answers timocracy
 noticeable qualities. described ill educated, but, like
 spartan, lover literature; although harsh master
 servants natural superiority them. character
 based upon reaction circumstances father,
 troubled city retired politics; mother,
 dissatisfied position, always urging towards life
 political ambition. character may origin,
 indeed livy attributes licinian laws feminine jealousy
 similar kind. obviously connection manner
 timocratic state springs ideal, mere
 accident timocratic man son retired statesman.

 two next stages decline constitutions even less
 historical foundation. trace greek history
 polity like spartan cretan passing oligarchy wealth,
 oligarchy wealth passing democracy. order
 history appears different; first, homeric times
 royal patriarchal form government, century two
 later succeeded oligarchy birth rather wealth,
 wealth accident hereditary possession
 land power. sometimes oligarchical government gave way
 government based upon qualification property, which, according
 aristotle's mode using words, would called timocracy;
 cities, athens, became conducting medium
 democracy. necessary order succession states;
 nor, indeed, order discerned endless fluctuation
 greek history (like tides euripus), except, perhaps,
 almost uniform tendency monarchy aristocracy earliest
 times. first sight appears similar inversion
 last step platonic succession; tyranny, instead
 natural end democracy, early greek history appears rather
 stage leading democracy; reign peisistratus sons
 episode comes legislation solon
 constitution cleisthenes; secret cause common
 seems led greater part hellas first appearance
 dawn history, e.g. athens, argos, corinth, sicyon, nearly
 every state exception sparta, similar stage
 tyranny ended either oligarchy democracy. must
 remember plato describing rather contemporary governments
 sicilian states, alternated democracy tyranny,
 ancient history athens corinth.

 portrait tyrant later greek
 delighted draw phalaris dionysius, which, lives
 mediaeval saints mythic heroes, conduct actions one
 attributed another order fill outline.
 enormity greek today believe them; tyrant
 negation government law; assassination glorious;
 crime, however unnatural, might probability
 attributed him. this, plato following common
 thought countrymen, embellished exaggerated
 power genius. need suppose drew
 life; knowledge tyrants derived personal
 acquaintance dionysius. manner speaks would
 rather tend render doubtful ever 'consorted' them,
 entertained schemes, attributed epistles,
 regenerating sicily help.

 plato hyperbolical serio-comic vein exaggerates follies
 democracy also sees reflected social life. democracy
 state individualism dissolution; every one
 right eyes. people animated common spirit
 liberty, rising one man repel persian host,
 leading idea democracy herodotus thucydides, never seems
 think. believer liberty, still less lover
 tyranny. deeper serious condemnation reserved
 tyrant, ideal wickedness also weakness,
 utter helplessness suspiciousness leading almost
 impossible existence, without remnant good which, plato's
 opinion, required give power evil (book i). ideal
 wickedness living helpless misery, reverse
 portrait perfect injustice ruling happiness splendour,
 first thrasymachus, afterwards sons ariston drawn,
 also reverse king whose rule life good
 subjects.

 governments individuals corresponding
 ethical gradation: ideal state rule reason,
 extinguishing harmonizing passions, training virtue;
 timocracy timocratic man constitution, whether
 state individual, based, first, upon courage, secondly,
 upon love honour; latter virtue, hardly
 esteemed virtue, superseded rest. second stage
 decline virtues altogether disappeared, love gain
 succeeded them; third stage, democracy, various
 passions allowed free play, virtues vices
 impartially cultivated. freedom, leads many curious
 extravagances character, reality state weakness
 dissipation. last, one monster passion takes possession whole
 nature man--this tyranny. excess--the excess first
 wealth freedom, element decay.

 eighth book republic abounds pictures life fanciful
 allusions; use metaphorical language carried greater
 extent anywhere else plato. may remark,

 (1), description two nations one, become
 divided greek republics, feudal times, perhaps
 also own;

 (2), notion democracy expressed sort pythagorean formula
 equality among unequals;

 (3), free easy ways men animals, characteristic
 liberty, foreign mercenaries universal mistrust
 tyrant;

 (4), proposal mere debts recoverable law
 speculation often entertained reformers law
 modern times, harmony tendencies modern
 legislation. debt land two great difficulties
 ancient lawgiver: modern times may said almost,
 quite, solved first difficulties, hardly second.

 still remarkable corresponding portraits individuals:
 family picture father mother old servant
 timocratical man, outward respectability inherent
 meanness oligarchical; uncontrolled licence freedom
 democrat, young alcibiades seems depicted,
 right wrong pleases, last, like prodigal,
 goes far country (note play language
 democratic man represented image state
 citadel receiving embassies); wild-beast nature,
 breaks loose successor. hit tyrant
 parricide; representation tyrant's life obscene dream;
 rhetorical surprise miserable miserable
 men book ix; hint poets friends
 tyrants place constitutional state,
 clever see propriety expulsion;
 continuous image drones two kinds, swelling last
 monster drone wings (book ix),--are among plato's
 happiest touches.

 remains considered great difficulty book
 republic, so-called number state. puzzle almost
 great number beast book revelation, though
 apparently known aristotle, referred cicero proverb
 obscurity (ep. ad att.). imagined answer
 puzzle, plato practising upon readers.
 deception inconsistent manner
 aristotle speaks number (pol.), would ridiculous
 reader republic acquainted greek mathematics.
 little reason supposing plato intentionally used
 obscure expressions; obscurity arises want familiarity
 subject. hand, plato indicates
 altogether serious, describing number solemn jest
 muses, appears imply degree satire symbolical
 use number. (compare cratylus; protag.)

 hope understanding passage depends principally accurate
 study words themselves; faint light thrown
 parallel passage ninth book. another help allusion
 aristotle, makes important remark latter part
 passage (greek) describes solid figure. (pol.--'he says
 nothing abiding, things change certain cycle;
 origin change base numbers
 ratio 4:3; combined figure five gives two
 harmonies; means number figure becomes solid.')
 clue may gathered appearance pythagorean
 triangle, denoted numbers 3, 4, 5, which,
 every right-angled triangle, squares two lesser sides equal
 square hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25).

 plato begins speaking perfect cyclical number (tim.), i.e.
 number sum divisors equals whole;
 divine perfect number lesser cycles revolutions
 complete. also speaks human imperfect number, four
 terms three intervals numbers related one another
 certain proportions; converts figures, finds
 raised third power certain elements
 number, give two 'harmonies,' one square, oblong;
 say square number answers divine,
 oblong number human cycle; intimation given
 first divine number represents period world, second
 period state, human race zeller supposes;
 divine number afterwards mentioned (arist.). second
 number generations births, presides
 mysterious manner stars preside them, which,
 according pythagoreans, opportunity, justice, marriage,
 represented number figure. probably number 216.

 explanation given text supposes two harmonies make
 number 8000. explanation derives certain plausibility
 circumstance 8000 ancient number spartan citizens
 (herod.), would plato might called 'a number
 nearly concerns population city'; mysterious disappearance
 spartan population may possibly suggested first
 cause decline states. lesser square 'harmony,' 400,
 might symbol guardians,--the larger oblong 'harmony,'
 people, numbers 3, 4, 5 might refer respectively
 three orders state parts soul, four virtues,
 five forms government. harmony musical scale,
 elsewhere used symbol harmony state, also
 indicated. numbers 3, 4, 5, represent sides
 pythagorean triangle, also denote intervals scale.

 terms used statement problem may explained
 follows. perfect number (greek), already stated, one
 equal sum divisors. thus 6, first perfect
 cyclical number, = 1 + 2 + 3. words (greek), 'terms' 'notes,'
 (greek), 'intervals,' applicable music well number
 figure. (greek) 'base' whole calculation depends,
 'lowest term' worked out. words (greek)
 variously translated--'squared cubed' (donaldson),
 'equalling equalled power' (weber), 'by involution
 evolution,' i.e. raising power extracting root (as
 translation). numbers called 'like unlike' (greek)
 factors sides planes cubes represent
 ratio: e.g. 8 27 = 2 cubed 3 cubed;
 conversely. 'waxing' (greek) numbers, called also 'increasing' (greek),
 exceeded sum divisors: e.g. 12
 18 less 16 21. 'waning' (greek) numbers, called also
 'decreasing' (greek) succeed sum divisors:
 e.g. 8 27 exceed 7 13. words translated 'commensurable
 agreeable one another' (greek) seem different ways
 describing relation, less precision.
 equivalent 'expressible terms relation one
 another,' like series 8, 12, 18, 27, numbers
 relation (1 1/2) preceding. 'base,' 'fundamental
 number, 1/3 added it' (1 1/3) = 4/3 musical
 fourth. (greek) 'proportion' numbers musical notes,
 applied either parts factors single number
 relation one number another. first harmony 'square'
 number (greek); second harmony 'oblong' number (greek), i.e.
 number representing figure opposite sides
 equal. (greek) = 'numbers squared from' 'upon diameters'; (greek)
 = 'rational,' i.e. omitting fractions, (greek), 'irrational,' i.e.
 including fractions; e.g. 49 square rational diameter
 figure side = 5: 50, irrational diameter same.
 several explanations given good deal besides
 indebted excellent article platonic number dr.
 donaldson (proc. philol. society).

 conclusions draws data summed
 follows. assumed number perfect divine cycle
 number world, number imperfect cycle
 number state, proceeds: 'the period world defined
 perfect number 6, state cube number
 216, product last pair terms platonic
 tetractys (a series seven terms, 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 8, 27);
 take basis computation, shall two cube
 numbers (greek), viz. 8 27; mean proportionals
 these, viz. 12 18, furnish three intervals four terms,
 terms intervals stand related one another
 sesqui-altera ratio, i.e. term preceding 3/2.
 remember number 216 = 8 x 27 = 3 cubed + 4 cubed + 5 cubed,
 3 squared + 4 squared = 5 squared, must admit
 number implies numbers 3, 4, 5, musicians attach much
 importance. combine ratio 4/3 number 5,
 multiply ratios sides hypotenuse, shall first
 squaring cubing obtain two expressions, denote ratio
 two last pairs terms platonic tetractys, former
 multiplied square, latter cube number 10,
 sum first four digits constitute platonic tetractys.'
 two (greek) elsewhere explains follows: 'the first (greek)
 (greek), words (4/3 x 5) squared = 100 x 2 squared 3
 squared. second (greek), cube root, described
 100 multiplied (alpha) rational diameter 5 diminished
 unity, i.e., shown above, 48: (beta) two incommensurable
 diameters, i.e. two first irrationals, 2 3: (gamma)
 cube 3, 27. thus (48 + 5 + 27) 100 = 1000 x 2 cubed.
 second harmony cube number former
 harmony square, therefore must divided cube
 3. words, whole expression be: (1), first
 harmony, 400/9: (2), second harmony, 8000/27.'

 reasons inclined agree dr. donaldson also
 schleiermacher supposing 216 platonic number
 births are: (1) coincides description number
 given first part passage (greek...): (2)
 number 216 permutations would familiar greek
 mathematician, though unfamiliar us: (3) 216 cube
 6, also sum 3 cubed, 4 cubed, 5 cubed, numbers 3, 4, 5
 representing pythagorean triangle, sides squared
 equal square hypotenuse (9 + 16 = 25): (4) also
 period pythagorean metempsychosis: (5) three ultimate
 terms bases (3, 4, 5) 216 composed answer third,
 fourth, fifth musical scale: (6) number 216
 product cubes 2 3, two last terms
 platonic tetractys: (7) pythagorean triangle said
 plutarch (de is. et osir.), proclus (super prima eucl.), quintilian
 (de musica) contained passage, tradition
 school seems point direction: (8)
 pythagorean triangle called also figure marriage (greek).

 though agreeing dr. donaldson thus far, see reason
 supposing, does, first perfect number world,
 human imperfect number state; given proof
 second harmony cube. think (greek) mean
 'two incommensurables,' arbitrarily assumes 2 3,
 rather, preceding clause implies, (greek), i.e. two square
 numbers based upon irrational diameters figure side
 5 = 50 x 2.

 greatest objection translation sense given
 words (greek), 'a base three third added it, multiplied
 5.' somewhat forced manner plato introduces
 numbers pythagorean triangle. coincidences numbers
 follow favour explanation. first harmony 400,
 already remarked, probably represents rulers; second
 oblong harmony 7600, people.

 third place, money-making.

 twice man overthrown unjust--once more,
 olympian contest, first offering prayer saviour zeus, let
 try fall. wise man whispers pleasures wise
 true pure; others shadow only. let us examine this:
 pleasure opposed pain, mean state
 neither? man sick, nothing pleasant
 health. never found well. pain
 desires cease pain; hand,
 ecstasy pleasure, rest painful him. thus rest cessation
 pleasure pain. neither become both?
 again, pleasure pain motions, absence rest;
 so, absence either other? thus

 absence pain, pure pain absence pleasure; although
 pleasures reach mind body reliefs

 confusion happens pleasure pain, many things.

 perhaps may remember one saying beginning
 discussion unjust man profited reputation
 justice. know nature justice injustice, let us
 make image soul, personify words. first all,
 fashion multitudinous beast, ring heads manner
 animals, tame wild, able produce change pleasure.
 suppose another form lion, another man; second
 smaller first, third second; join together
 cover human skin, completely
 concealed. done, let us tell supporter
 injustice feeding beasts starving man.
 maintainer justice, hand, trying strengthen
 man; nourishing gentle principle within him, making
 alliance lion heart, order may able keep
 many-headed hydra, bring unity

 wrong.

 now, let us reason unjust, intentionally
 error. noble subjects beast man,
 rather god man; ignoble, subjects man
 beast? so, would receive gold condition
 degrade noblest part worst?--who would sell
 son daughter hands brutal evil men, amount
 money? sell fairer diviner part without
 compunction godless foul? would worse
 eriphyle, sold husband's life necklace? intemperance
 letting loose multiform monster, pride sullenness
 growth increase lion serpent element,
 luxury effeminacy caused great relaxation spirit.
 flattery meanness arise spirited element subjected
 avarice, lion habituated become monkey. real
 disgrace handicraft arts is, engaged

 law desires nurse higher principle,
 acquired this, may go ways.

 'what, then, shall man profit, gain whole world' become
 wicked? shall profit escaping discovery,
 concealment evil prevents cure? punished,
 brute within would silenced, gentler element
 liberated; would united temperance, justice, wisdom

 noticeable points 9th book republic are:--(1)
 account pleasure; (2) number interval divides
 king tyrant; (3) pattern heaven.

 1. plato's account pleasure remarkable moderation,
 respect contrasts later platonists views
 attributed aristotle. not, like cynics, opposed
 pleasure, rather desires several parts
 soul shall natural satisfaction; even agrees
 epicureans describing pleasure something absence
 pain. proved circumstance pleasures
 antecedent pains (as also remarks philebus),
 pleasures smell, also pleasures hope anticipation.
 previous book made distinction necessary
 unnecessary pleasure, repeated aristotle,
 observes class 'wild beast' pleasures,
 corresponding aristotle's (greek). dwells upon relative
 unreal character sensual pleasures illusion arises
 contrast pleasure pain, pointing superiority
 pleasures reason, rest, fleeting pleasures
 sense emotion. pre-eminence royal pleasure shown
 fact reason able form judgment lower pleasures,
 two lower parts soul incapable judging
 pleasures reason. thus, treatment pleasure, many
 subjects, philosophy plato 'sawn quantities'
 aristotle; analysis originally made became
 next generation foundation technical distinctions.
 plato aristotle note illusion ancients
 fell regarding transience pleasure proof
 unreality, confounding permanence intellectual
 pleasures unchangeableness knowledge
 derived. neither like admit pleasures knowledge,
 though elevating, lasting pleasures,
 almost equally dependent accidents bodily state
 (introduction philebus).

 2. number interval separates king tyrant,
 royal tyrannical pleasures, 729, cube 9. plato
 characteristically designates number concerned human life,
 nearly equivalent number days nights
 year. desirous proclaiming interval
 immeasurable, invents formula give expression idea.
 spoke justice cube, virtue art measuring
 (prot.), saw inappropriateness conceiving soul
 figure line, pleasure tyrant separated
 pleasure king numerical interval 729. modern
 times sometimes use metaphorically plato employed
 philosophical formula. 'it easy estimate loss
 tyrant, except perhaps way,' says plato. might say,
 although life good man compared bad
 man, yet may measure difference valuing one
 minute one hour ('one day thy courts
 better thousand'), might say 'there infinite
 difference.' much saying, homely phrase, 'they
 thousand miles asunder.' accordingly plato finds natural
 vehicle thoughts progression numbers; arithmetical
 formula draws utmost seriousness,
 number generation seems find additional proof truth
 speculation forming number geometrical figure;
 persons day apt fancy statement verified
 thrown abstract form. speaking
 number 729 proper human life, probably intended intimate
 one year tyrannical = 12 hours royal life.

 simple observation comparison two similar solids
 effected comparison cubes sides,
 mathematical groundwork fanciful expression.
 difficulty explaining steps number 729 obtained;
 oligarch removed third degree royal
 aristocratical, tyrant third degree
 oligarchical; arrange terms sides square
 count oligarch twice over, thus reckoning = 5
 = 9. square 9 passed lightly step towards
 cube.

 3. towards close republic, plato seems
 convinced ideal character speculations. end
 9th book pattern heaven takes place
 city philosophers earth. vision received form
 substance hands, discovered distance. yet
 distant kingdom also rule man's life. ('say lo! here,
 lo! there, kingdom god within you.') thus note
 struck prepares revelation future life
 following book. future life present still; ideal
 politics realized individual.

 book x. many things pleased order state,
 nothing liked better regulation poetry.
 division soul throws new light exclusion imitation.
 mind telling confidence poetry outrage
 understanding, unless hearers balm knowledge
 heals error. loved homer ever since boy, even
 appears great master tragic poetry. much
 love man, love truth more, therefore must speak out:
 first all, explain imitation, really
 understand? 'how likely understand!' might
 well be, duller often sees better keener eye. 'true,
 presence hardly venture say think.'
 suppose begin old fashion, doctrine
 universals. let us assume existence beds tables. one
 idea bed, table, maker mind
 making them; make ideas beds tables,
 made beds tables according ideas. maker
 works workmen, makes vessels plants
 animals, himself, earth heaven, things heaven
 earth? makes gods also. 'he must wizard indeed!'
 see sense could same?
 take mirror, catch reflection sun,
 earth, anything else--there made them. 'yes,
 appearance.' exactly so; painter creator
 mirror, even unreal carpenter; although
 neither carpenter artist supposed make
 absolute bed. 'not philosophers may believed.' need wonder
 bed imperfect relation truth. reflect:--here
 three beds; one nature, made god; another,
 made carpenter; third, painter. god made one,
 could made one; two,
 would always third--more absolute abstract either,
 would included. may therefore conceive god
 natural maker bed, lower sense carpenter
 also maker; painter rather imitator
 two make; creation thrice removed
 reality. tragic poet imitator, and, like every
 imitator, thrice removed king truth.
 painter imitates original bed, bed made
 carpenter. this, without really different, appears
 different, many points view, one caught
 painter, represents everything represents piece
 everything, piece image. paint artist,
 although knows nothing arts; sufficient skill
 deceive children simple people. suppose somebody came
 us told us, met man knew everybody knows,
 better anybody:--should infer simpleton who,
 discernment truth falsehood, met wizard
 enchanter, fancied all-wise? hear persons
 saying homer tragedians know arts
 virtues, must infer similar delusion?
 see poets imitators, creations
 imitations. 'very true.' person could create well
 imitate, would rather leave permanent work imitation
 only; would rather receiver giver praise? 'yes,
 would honour advantage.'

 let us interrogate homer poets. friend homer, say him,
 going ask medicine, art
 poems incidentally refer, main subjects--war, military
 tactics, politics. twice thrice removed
 truth--not imitator image-maker, please inform us good
 ever done mankind? city professes
 received laws you, sicily italy charondas, sparta
 lycurgus, athens solon? war ever carried
 counsels? invention attributed you, thales
 anacharsis? homeric way life,
 pythagorean was, instructed men, called
 you? 'no, indeed; creophylus (flesh-child) even unfortunate
 breeding name, if, tradition says, homer
 lifetime allowed friends starve.' yes,
 could ever happened homer really educator
 hellas? would many devoted followers? protagoras
 prodicus persuade contemporaries one manage
 house state without them, likely homer hesiod would
 allowed go beggars--i mean really
 able world good?--would men compelled
 stay were, followed order get
 education? not; therefore may infer homer
 poets imitators, imitate appearances
 things. painter knowledge figure colour paint
 cobbler without practice cobbling, poet delineate
 art colours language, give harmony rhythm
 cobbler also general; know mere narration,
 deprived ornaments metre, like face lost
 beauty youth never other. more, imitator
 knowledge reality, appearance. painter paints,
 artificer makes bridle reins, neither understands use
 them--the knowledge confined horseman;
 things. thus three arts: one use, another invention,
 third imitation; user furnishes rule two others.
 flute-player know good bad flute, maker
 put faith him; imitator neither know
 faith--neither science true opinion ascribed him.
 imitation, then, devoid knowledge, kind play
 sport, tragic epic poets imitators highest
 degree.

 let us enquire, faculty man answers
 imitation. allow explain meaning: objects differently seen
 water water, near
 distance; painter juggler makes use variation
 impose upon us. art measuring weighing calculating
 comes save bewildered minds power appearance; for,
 saying, two contrary opinions
 time, cannot true.
 true determined art calculation; allied
 better faculty soul, arts imitation worse.
 holds ear well eye, poetry well
 painting. imitation actions voluntary involuntary,
 expectation good bad result, present
 experience pleasure pain. man harmony
 subject conflicting influences?
 rather contradiction him? let ask, whether
 likely control sorrow alone company.
 'in latter case.' feeling would lead indulge sorrow,
 reason law control enjoin patience; since cannot know
 whether affliction good evil, human thing
 great consequence, sorrow certainly hindrance good
 counsel. stumble, not, like children, make
 uproar; take measures reason prescribes, raising
 lament, finding cure. better part us ready
 follow reason, irrational principle full sorrow
 distraction recollection troubles. unfortunately, however,
 latter furnishes chief materials imitative arts. whereas
 reason ever repose cannot easily displayed, especially
 mixed multitude experience her. thus poet like
 painter two ways: first paints inferior degree truth,
 secondly, concerned inferior part soul. indulges
 feelings, enfeebles reason; refuse allow
 authority mind man; measure greater
 less, maker images far gone truth.

 yet mentioned heaviest count indictment--the
 power poetry injuriously exciting feelings.
 hear passage hero laments sufferings tedious
 length, know sympathize praise poet;
 yet sorrows exhibition feeling regarded
 effeminate unmanly (ion). now, ought man feel pleasure
 seeing another hates abominates himself?
 giving way sentiment case would control?--he
 guard sorrow another's; thinks
 may indulge feelings without disgrace, gainer
 pleasure. inevitable consequence begins
 weeping sorrows others, end weeping own.
 true comedy,--you may often laugh buffoonery
 would ashamed utter, love coarse merriment stage
 last turn buffoon home. poetry feeds waters
 passions desires; lets rule instead ruling them.
 therefore, hear encomiasts homer affirming
 educator hellas, life regulated
 precepts, may allow excellence intentions, agree
 thinking homer great poet tragedian. shall
 continue prohibit poetry goes beyond hymns gods
 praises famous men. pleasure pain, law reason shall
 rule state.

 grounds expelling poetry; lest charge
 us discourtesy, let us also make apology her. remind
 ancient quarrel poetry philosophy,
 many traces writings poets,
 saying 'the she-dog, yelping mistress,' 'the philosophers
 ready circumvent zeus,' 'the philosophers
 paupers.' nevertheless bear ill-will, gladly allow
 return upon condition makes defence
 verse; supporters poets may speak prose.
 confess charms; cannot show useful well
 delightful, like rational lovers, must renounce love,
 though endeared us early associations. come years
 discretion, know poetry truth, man
 careful introduces state constitution
 is; mighty issue stake--no less good
 evil human soul. worth forsake justice
 virtue attractions poetry, sake
 honour wealth. 'i agree you.'

 yet rewards virtue greater far described.
 'and conceive things greater still?' not, perhaps, brief
 span life: immortal care anything short
 eternity? 'i understand mean?' know
 soul immortal? 'surely prepared prove that?' indeed
 am. 'then let hear argument, make light.'

 would admit everything element good evil.
 things inherent corruption; cannot destroy
 them, nothing else will. soul corrupting principles,
 injustice, intemperance, cowardice, like. none
 destroy soul sense disease destroys body.
 soul may full iniquities, not, reason them,
 brought nearer death. nothing destroyed within
 ever perished external affection evil. body, one
 thing, cannot destroyed food, another, unless badness
 food communicated body. neither soul,
 one thing, corrupted body, another, unless
 infected. bodily evil infect soul, neither
 bodily evil, whether disease violence, destroy
 soul, unless shown render unholy unjust.
 one ever prove souls men become unjust
 die. person audacity say contrary, answer
 is--then criminals require hand executioner,
 die themselves? 'truly,' said, 'injustice would
 terrible brought cessation evil; rather believe
 injustice murders others may tend quicken stimulate
 life unjust.' quite right. sin
 natural inherent evil cannot destroy soul, hardly anything
 else destroy her. soul cannot destroyed either
 internal external evil must immortal everlasting.
 true, souls always exist number. cannot
 diminish, cannot destroyed; yet increase,
 increase immortal must come something mortal,
 would end immortality. neither soul variable diverse;
 immortal must fairest simplest composition.
 would conceive truly, behold justice injustice
 nature, must viewed light reason pure
 birth, reflected philosophy holding converse
 divine immortal eternal. present condition see
 like sea-god glaucus, bruised maimed sea
 world, covered shells stones incrusted upon
 entertainments earth.

 thus far, argument required, said nothing rewards
 honours poets attribute justice; contented
 showing justice best soul
 herself, even man put gyges' ring helmet
 hades too. shall repay borrowed;
 enumerate rewards justice life death. granted,
 sake argument, remember, evil might
 perhaps escape knowledge gods men, although really
 impossible. since shown justice reality, must
 grant also palm appearance. first place,
 man known gods, therefore friend
 gods, receive hands every good, always excepting
 evil necessary consequence former sins. things end
 good him, either life death, even appears
 evil; gods care desires
 likeness. shall say men? honesty best policy?
 clever rogue makes great start first, breaks
 reaches goal, slinks away dishonour; whereas true runner
 perseveres end, receives prize. must allow
 repeat blessings attributed fortunate
 unjust--they bear rule city, marry give marriage
 will; evils attributed unfortunate
 just, really fall end unjust, although, implied,
 sufferings better veiled silence.

 blessings present life nothing compared
 await good men death. 'i like hear
 them.' come, then, tell story er, son
 armenius, valiant man. supposed died battle, ten
 days afterwards body found untouched corruption sent home

 tenfold--now journey thousand years' duration,

 infants dying almost soon born. parricides
 murderers tortures still terrible narrate.
 present one spirits asked--where ardiaeus great?
 (this ardiaeus cruel tyrant, murdered father,
 elder brother, thousand years before.) another spirit answered,
 'he comes hither, never come. myself,' added,
 'actually saw terrible sight. entrance chasm,
 reascend, ardiaeus appeared, sinners--most
 tyrants, all--and fancied

 fiery-looking men knew meaning sound, seized
 several others, bound hand foot threw down,
 dragged along side road, lacerating carding
 like wool, explaining passers-by, going

 lest hear voice, silence one one

 tenth book republic plato falls two divisions: first,
 resuming old thread interrupted, socrates assails
 poets, who, nature soul analyzed,
 seen far gone truth; secondly, shown
 reality happiness just, demands appearance shall
 restored him, proceeds prove immortality
 soul. argument, phaedo gorgias, supplemented
 vision future life.

 plato, poet, whose dialogues poems
 dramas, hostile poets class, especially
 dramatic poets; seen truth may
 embodied verse well prose,
 indefinable lights shadows human life expressed
 poetry--some elements imagination always entwine
 reason; supposed epic verse inseparably
 associated impurities old hellenic mythology;
 try homer hesiod unfair prosaic test
 utility,--are questions always debated amongst students
 plato. though unable give complete answer them, may
 show--first, views arose naturally circumstances
 age; secondly, may elicit truth well error
 contained them.

 enemy poets poetry declining
 lifetime, theatrocracy, says laws, taken
 place intellectual aristocracy. euripides exhibited last phase
 tragic drama, plato saw friend apologist
 tyrants, sophist tragedy. old comedy almost extinct;
 new yet arisen. dramatic lyric poetry, like every
 branch greek literature, falling power rhetoric.
 'second third' aeschylus sophocles
 generation followed them. aristophanes, one later
 comedies (frogs), speaks 'thousands tragedy-making prattlers,'
 whose attempts poetry compares chirping swallows; 'their
 garrulity went far beyond euripides,'--'they appeared upon
 stage, end them.' man genius
 real appreciation godlike aeschylus noble gentle
 sophocles, though disagreeing parts 'theology'
 (rep.), 'minor poets' must contemptible intolerable.
 feeling stronger dialogues plato sense
 decline decay literature politics marked
 age. expected look favour
 licence aristophanes, end career, begun
 satirizing socrates clouds, similar spirit forty years
 afterwards satirized founders ideal commonwealths
 eccleziazusae, female parliament (laws).

 reasons antagonism plato poetry.
 profession actor regarded degradation human
 nature, 'one man life' cannot 'play many parts;'
 characters actor performs seem destroy character,
 leave nothing truly called himself. neither
 man live life act it. actor slave art,
 master it. taking view plato decided expulsion
 dramatic epic poets, though must known
 greek tragedians afforded noble lessons examples virtue
 patriotism, nothing homer compared. great
 dramatic even great rhetorical power hardly consistent
 firmness strength mind, dramatic talent often incidentally
 associated weak dissolute character.

 tenth book plato introduces new series objections. first,
 says poet painter imitator, third
 degree removed truth. creations tested rule
 measure; appearances. modern times say
 art merely imitation, rather expression ideal
 forms sense. even adopting humble image plato,
 argument derives colour, maintain artist may
 ennoble bed paints folds drapery,
 feeling home introduces; modern
 painters imparted ideal interest blacksmith's
 carpenter's shop. eye mind feels well sees give
 dignity pathos ruined mill, straw-built shed (rembrandt),
 hull vessel 'going last home' (turner). still
 would apply greatest works art, seem
 visible embodiment divine. plato asked whether zeus
 athene pheidias imitation imitation only, would
 compelled admit something found
 form mortal; rule proportion
 conformed 'higher far geometry arithmetic
 could express?' (statesman.)

 again, plato objects imitative arts express
 emotional rather rational part human nature.
 admit aristotle's theory, tragedy serious imitations
 purgation passions pity fear; appear
 afford opportunity indulging them. yet must acknowledge
 may sometimes cure disordered emotions giving expression them;
 often gain strength pent within breast.
 every indulgence feelings condemned.
 may gratification higher well
 lower--thoughts deep sad expressed
 ourselves, may find utterance words poets. every one would
 acknowledge times consoled
 elevated beautiful music sublimity architecture
 peacefulness nature. plato admitted, earlier
 part republic, arts might effect harmonizing
 well enervating mind; tenth book regards
 stoic puritan medium. asks 'what good
 done?' satisfied reply, 'they given
 innocent pleasure mankind.'

 tells us rejoices banishment poets, since
 found analysis soul concerned
 inferior faculties. means say higher faculties
 universals, lower particulars sense. poets
 level age, level socrates plato;
 well aware homer hesiod could made rule
 life process legitimate interpretation; ironical use
 fact denial authority; saw, too,
 poets critics--as says apology, 'any one better
 interpreter writings themselves.
 ceased poet became disciple socrates; though,
 tells us solon, 'he might one greatest them,
 deterred pursuits' (tim.) thus many points
 view antagonism plato poets,
 foreshadowed old quarrel philosophy poetry.
 poets, says protagoras, sophists day;
 dislike one class reflected other. regards
 enemies reasoning abstraction, though
 case euripides reference immoral sentiments
 tyrants like. plato prophet 'came world
 convince men'--first fallibility sense opinion,
 secondly reality abstract ideas. whatever strangeness
 may modern times opposing philosophy poetry, us
 seem many elements common, strangeness disappear
 conceive poetry allied sense, philosophy
 equivalent thought abstraction. unfortunately word
 'idea,' plato expressive real things,
 associated minds element subjectiveness unreality.
 may note also differs aristotle declares poetry
 truer history, opposite reason, concerned
 universals, like history, particulars (poet).

 things seen opposed scripture things
 unseen--they equally opposed plato universals ideas.
 particulars appear floating world sense;
 taint error even evil. difficulty
 seeing illusion; error variation
 individual man, horse, bed, etc., class man, horse,
 bed, etc.; truth displayed individual instances
 less certain conveyed medium
 ideas. plato, deeply impressed real importance
 universals instruments thought, attributes essential
 truth imaginary unreal; universals may often false
 particulars true. attained clear conception
 individual, synthesis universal particular;
 able distinguish opinion sensation,
 ambiguity words (greek) like, tended confuse,
 would denied truth particulars sense.

 poets also representatives falsehood feigning
 departments life knowledge, like sophists
 rhetoricians gorgias phaedrus; false priests,
 false prophets, lying spirits, enchanters world. another
 count put indictment plato,
 friends tyrant, bask sunshine patronage.
 despotism ages apparatus false ideas false
 teachers service--in history modern europe well
 greece rome. government men depends solely upon force;
 without corruption literature morals--some appeal
 imagination masses--some pretence favour heaven--some
 element good giving power evil, tyranny, even short time,
 cannot maintained. greek tyrants insensible
 importance awakening cause pseudo-hellenic feeling;
 proud successes olympic games; devoid
 love literature art. plato thinking first instance
 greek poets graced courts dionysius archelaus:
 old spirit freedom roused within prostitution
 tragic muse praises tyranny. prophetic eye extends
 beyond false teachers ages creatures
 government live. compares corruption
 contemporaries idea perfect society, gathers
 one mass evil evils errors mankind;
 personified rhetoricians, sophists, poets, rulers deceive
 govern world.

 objection plato makes poetry imitative
 arts excite emotions. modern reader
 disposed introduce distinction appears escaped him.
 emotions neither bad good themselves,
 likely controlled attempt eradicate them,
 moderate indulgence them. vocation art present
 thought form feeling, enlist feelings side
 reason, inspire even moment courage resignation; perhaps
 suggest sense infinity eternity way mere language
 incapable attaining. true, power purer age
 art embodies gods heroes only, may made express voluptuous
 image corinthian courtezan. shows art, like
 outward things, may turned good also evil,
 closely connected higher lower part
 soul. imitative art subject certain limitations, therefore
 necessarily partakes nature compromise. something ideal
 truth sacrificed sake representation, something
 exactness representation sacrificed ideal. still,
 works art permanent element; idealize detain
 passing thought, intermediates sense ideas.

 present stage human mind, poetry forms
 fiction may certainly regarded good. also imagine
 existence age severer conception truth either
 banished transformed them. rate must admit hold
 different place different periods world's history.
 infancy mankind, poetry, exception proverbs,
 whole literature, instrument intellectual culture;
 modern times shadow echo former self, appears
 precarious existence. milton day doubted whether
 epic poem longer possible. time must remember,
 plato would called charms poetry partly
 transferred prose; (statesman) admits rhetoric
 handmaiden politics, proposes find strain law (laws)
 substitute old poets. among creative power seems
 often growing weaker, scientific fact engrossing
 overpowering mind formerly. illusion feelings

 still remain considered points

 republic, presents two faces--one hellenic state,
 kingdom philosophers. connected latter two aspects
 (2) paradoxes republic, termed
 morgenstern: (a) community property; (b) families; (c)
 rule philosophers; (d) analogy individual state,
 which, like analogies republic, carried far.
 may proceed consider (3) subject education conceived
 plato, bringing together general view education youth
 education after-life; (4) may note essential
 differences ancient modern politics suggested
 republic; (5) may compare politicus laws; (6) may
 observe influence exercised plato imitators; (7)
 take occasion consider nature value political, (8)
 religious ideals.

 1. plato expressly says intending found hellenic state
 (book v). many regulations characteristically spartan;
 prohibition gold silver, common meals men,
 military training youth, gymnastic exercises women.
 life sparta life camp (laws), enforced even
 rigidly time peace war; citizens sparta, like
 plato's, forbidden trade--they soldiers
 shopkeepers. nowhere else greece individual completely
 subjected state; time marry, education
 children, clothes wear, food
 eat, prescribed law. best enactments
 republic, reverence paid parents elders,
 worst, exposure deformed children,
 borrowed practice sparta. encouragement friendships
 men youths, men one another, affording
 incentives bravery, also spartan; sparta nearer approach
 made greek state equality sexes,
 community property; probably less
 licentiousness sense immorality, tie marriage
 regarded lightly rest greece. 'suprema lex'
 preservation family, interest state.
 coarse strength military government favourable purity
 refinement; excessive strictness regulations seems
 produced reaction. hellenes spartans
 accessible bribery; several greatest might
 described words plato 'fierce secret longing
 gold silver.' though strict sense communists,
 principle communism maintained among division
 lands, common meals, slaves, free use
 one another's goods. marriage public institution: women
 educated state, sang danced public men.

 many traditions preserved sparta severity
 magistrates maintained primitive rule music poetry;
 republic plato, new-fangled poet expelled. hymns
 gods, kind music admitted ideal
 state, kind permitted sparta. spartans,
 though unpoetical race, nevertheless lovers poetry;
 stirred elegiac strains tyrtaeus, crowded around
 hippias hear recitals homer; resembled
 citizens timocratic rather ideal state. council
 elder men also corresponds spartan gerousia; freedom
 permitted judge matters detail agrees
 told institution. more, military rule
 spoiling dead offering arms temples; moderation
 pursuit enemies; importance attached physical
 well-being citizens; use warfare sake defence
 rather aggression--are features probably suggested spirit
 practice sparta.

 spartan type ideal state reverts first decline;
 character individual timocrat borrowed spartan
 citizen. love lacedaemon affected plato xenophon,
 shared many undistinguished athenians; seemed
 find principle wanting democracy. (greek)
 spartans attracted them, say, goodness
 laws, spirit order loyalty prevailed.
 fascinated idea, citizens athens would imitate
 lacedaemonians dress manners; known
 contemporaries plato 'the persons ears bruised,'
 like roundheads commonwealth. love another church
 country seen distance only, longing imaginary
 simplicity civilized times, fond desire past never
 been, future never be,--these aspirations
 human mind often felt among ourselves. feelings meet
 response republic plato.

 features platonic republic, as, example,
 literary philosophical education, grace beauty
 life, reverse spartan. plato wishes give
 citizens taste athenian freedom well lacedaemonian
 discipline. individual genius purely athenian, although theory
 lover sparta; something either--he
 also true hellenic feeling. desirous humanizing wars
 hellenes one another; acknowledges delphian god
 grand hereditary interpreter hellas. spirit harmony
 dorian mode prevail, whole state
 external beauty reflex harmony within.
 yet found truth afterwards enunciated
 laws--that better legislator made men one mind,
 trained war. citizens, hellenic
 states, democratic well aristocratic, really upper class;
 for, although mention made slaves, lower classes
 allowed fade away distance, represented
 individual passions. plato idea either social state
 classes harmonized, federation hellas
 world different nations states place. city
 equipped war rather peace, would seem
 justified ordinary condition hellenic states. myth
 earth-born men embodiment orthodox tradition hellas,
 allusion four ages world also sanctioned
 authority hesiod poets. thus see republic
 partly founded ideal old greek polis, partly actual
 circumstances hellas age. plato, like old painters,
 retains traditional form, like also vision
 city clouds.

 yet another thread interwoven texture
 work; republic dorian state, pythagorean
 league. 'way life' connected name
 pythagoras, like catholic monastic orders, showed power
 mind individual might exercise contemporaries,
 may naturally suggested plato possibility reviving
 'mediaeval institutions.' pythagoreans, like plato, enforced rule
 life moral intellectual training. influence ascribed
 music, us seems exaggerated, also pythagorean feature;
 regarded representing real influence music
 greek world. nearly government hellas,
 pythagorean league three hundred aristocracy virtue.
 history mankind philosophy order (greek),
 expressing consequently enlisting side combined
 endeavours better part people, obtained management
 public affairs held possession considerable time (until
 b.c. 500). probably states prepared dorian institutions
 would league possible. rulers, like plato's
 (greek), required submit severe training order
 prepare way education members community.
 long dissolution order, eminent pythagoreans,
 archytas tarentum, retained political influence cities
 magna graecia. much suggestive kindred
 spirit plato, doubtless meditated deeply 'way life
 pythagoras' (rep.) followers. slight traces pythagoreanism
 found mystical number state, number
 expresses interval king tyrant, doctrine
 transmigration, music spheres, well great
 though secondary importance ascribed mathematics education.

 philosophy, also form state, goes far
 beyond old pythagoreans. attempts task really impossible,
 unite past greek history future philosophy,
 analogous impossibility, often dream
 christendom, attempt unite past history europe
 kingdom christ. nothing actually existing world
 resembles plato's ideal state; imagine
 state possible. repeats again; e.g.
 republic, laws where, casting glance back republic,
 admits perfect state communism philosophy
 impossible age, though still retained pattern.
 doubt implied earnestness argues
 republic ideals none worse cannot realized
 fact, chorus laughter, like breaking wave will,
 anticipates, greet mention proposals; though like
 writers fiction, uses art give reality
 inventions. asked ideal polity come being,
 answers ironically, 'when one son king becomes philosopher';
 designates fiction earth-born men 'a noble lie';
 structure finally complete, fairly tells republic
 vision only, sense may reality,
 vulgar one reign philosophers upon earth. said
 plato flies well walks, falls short truth;
 flies walks time, air firm ground
 successive instants.

 niebuhr asked trifling question, may briefly noticed
 place--was plato good citizen? meant, loyal
 athenian institutions?--he hardly said friend
 democracy: neither friend existing form
 government; regarded 'states faction' (laws); none
 attained ideal voluntary rule voluntary subjects,
 seems indeed nearly describe democracy other;
 worst tyranny. truth is, question hardly
 meaning applied great philosopher whose writings meant
 particular age country, time mankind.
 decline athenian politics probably motive led plato
 frame ideal state, republic may regarded reflecting
 departing glory hellas. well might complain st. augustine,
 whose great work 'the city god' originated similar motive,
 loyal roman empire. even nearer parallel might
 afforded first christians, cannot fairly charged
 bad citizens because, though 'subject higher powers,'
 looking forward city heaven.

 2. idea perfect state full paradox judged
 according ordinary notions mankind. paradoxes one age
 said become commonplaces next;
 paradoxes plato least paradoxical us
 contemporaries. modern world either sneered absurd,
 denounced unnatural immoral; men pleased
 find aristotle's criticisms anticipation
 good sense. wealthy cultivated classes disliked also
 dreaded them; pointed satisfaction failure
 efforts realize practice. yet since thoughts
 one greatest human intelligences, one done
 elevate morality religion, seem deserve better
 treatment hands. may address public, plato
 poetry, assure mean harm existing institutions.
 serious errors side truth therefore
 may fairly demand careful consideration: truths mixed
 error may indeed say, 'the half better whole.'
 yet 'the half' may important contribution study human
 nature.

 (a) first paradox community goods, mentioned
 slightly end third book, seemingly, aristotle
 observes, confined guardians; least mention made
 classes. omission real significance,
 probably arises plan work, prevents writer
 entering details.

 aristotle censures community property much spirit
 modern political economy, tending repress industry,
 away spirit benevolence. modern writers almost refuse
 consider subject, supposed long ago settled
 common opinion mankind. must remembered
 sacredness property notion far fixed modern
 ancient times. world grown older, therefore
 conservative. primitive society offered many examples land held
 common, either tribe township, may probably
 original form landed tenure. ancient legislators
 invented various modes dividing preserving divisions land
 among citizens; according aristotle nations held
 land common divided produce, others
 divided land stored produce common. evils debt
 inequality property far greater ancient modern
 times, accidents property subject war,
 revolution, taxation, legislative interference, also
 greater. circumstances gave property less fixed sacred
 character. early christians believed held property
 common, principle sanctioned words christ
 himself, maintained counsel perfection almost
 ages church. wanting instances modern
 enthusiasts made religion communism; every age
 religious excitement notions like wycliffe's 'inheritance grace'
 tended prevail. like spirit, fiercer violent,
 appeared politics. 'the preparation gospel peace' soon
 becomes red flag republicanism.

 hardly judge effect plato's views would upon
 contemporaries; would perhaps seemed
 exaggeration spartan commonwealth. even modern writers would
 acknowledge right private property based expediency,
 may interfered variety ways public good.
 mode vesting property found advantageous,
 would time acquire basis right; 'the useful,'
 plato's words, 'would sacred.' lawyers ecclesiastics
 former ages would spoken property sacred institution.
 meant language oppose greatest amount
 resistance invasion rights individuals
 church.

 consider question, without fear immediate application
 practice, spirit plato's republic, quite sure
 received notions property best? distribution
 wealth customary civilized countries favourable
 conceived education development mass
 mankind? 'the spectator time existence' quite
 convinced one two thousand years hence, great changes
 taken place rights property, even notion
 property, beyond necessary personal maintenance, may
 disappeared? distinction familiar aristotle, though
 likely laughed among ourselves. change would
 greater changes world passed
 transition ancient modern society, example,
 emancipation serfs russia, abolition slavery
 america west indies; great difference
 separates eastern village community western world.
 accomplish revolution course centuries, would
 imply rate progress rapid actually taken place
 last fifty sixty years. kingdom japan underwent
 change five six years europe five six hundred.
 many opinions beliefs cherished among
 quite strongly sacredness property passed away;
 untenable propositions respecting right bequests
 entail maintained much fervour moderate.
 one heard ask whether state society final
 interests thousands perilled life character
 single person. many indulge hope present
 condition may, all, transitional, may conduct
 higher, property, besides ministering enjoyment
 few, may also furnish means highest culture all,
 greater benefit public generally, also
 control public authority. may come time saying,
 'have right own?' appear
 barbarous relic individualism;--when possession part may
 greater blessing possession whole
 one.

 reflections appear visionary eye practical statesman,
 within range possibility philosopher.
 imagine distant age clime, influence
 individual, notion common property may might sunk
 deep heart race, become fixed them,
 private property ourselves. knows latter institution
 four five thousand years old: may end revert
 beginning? age even utopias affect spirit
 legislation, abstract idea may exercise great influence
 practical politics.

 objections would generally urged plato's community
 property, old ones aristotle, motives exertion
 would taken away, disputes would arise
 dependent upon all. every man would produce little consume
 much liked. experience civilized nations hitherto
 adverse socialism. effort great human nature; men try
 live common, personal feeling always breaking in.
 hand may doubted whether present notions property
 conventional, differ different countries
 different states society. boast individualism
 freedom, rather artificial result industrial state
 modern europe. individual nominally free, also
 powerless world bound hand foot chains economic
 necessity. even cannot expect mass mankind become
 disinterested, rate observe power organization
 fifty years ago would never suspected. forces
 revolutionized political system europe, may effect
 similar change social industrial relations mankind.
 suppose influence good well neutral motives working
 community, absurdity expecting
 mass mankind power, becoming enlightened higher
 possibilities human life, learn much attainable
 present possession favoured few, may pursue
 common interest intelligence persistency mankind
 hitherto never seen.

 world set motion, longer held
 fast tyranny custom ignorance; criticism
 pierced veil tradition past longer overpowers
 present,--the progress civilization may expected far greater
 swifter heretofore. even present rate speed point
 may arrive two three generations beyond power
 imagination foresee. forces world work,
 arithmetical, geometrical ratio increase.
 education, use expression plato, moves like wheel
 ever-multiplying rapidity. say great may
 influence, becomes universal,--when inherited
 many generations,--when freed trammels superstition
 rightly adapted wants capacities different classes
 men women. neither know much co-operation
 minds hands may capable accomplishing, whether labour
 study. resources natural sciences half-developed
 yet; soil earth, instead growing barren, may
 become many times fertile hitherto; uses machinery far
 greater, also minute present. new secrets physiology
 may revealed, deeply affecting human nature innermost
 recesses. standard health may raised lives men
 prolonged sanitary medical knowledge. may peace,
 may leisure, may innocent refreshments many kinds.
 ever-increasing power locomotion may join extremes earth.
 may mysterious workings human mind, occur
 great crises history. east west may meet together,
 nations may contribute thoughts experience
 common stock humanity. many elements enter speculation
 kind. better make end them.
 reflections appear majority far-fetched, men science,
 commonplace.

 (b) neither mind plato aristotle doctrine
 community property present difficulty, appear
 violation common hellenic sentiment, community
 wives children. paradox prefaces another proposal,
 occupations men women shall same,
 end shall common training education. male
 female animals pursuits--why also two sexes
 man?

 fallen contradiction? saying
 different natures different pursuits. men
 women same? proposal inconsistent
 notion division labour?--these objections sooner raised
 answered; for, according plato, organic difference
 men women, accidental one men beget
 women bear children. following analogy animals,
 contends natural gifts scattered indifferently among
 sexes, though may superiority degree part
 men. objection score decency taking part
 gymnastic exercises, met plato's assertion
 existing feeling matter habit.

 plato emancipated ideas

 brings, sentiment, philosophy bear upon question

 modern antagonist equality sexes would argue
 differences men women confined single point
 urged plato; sensibility, gentleness, grace, qualities
 women, energy, strength, higher intelligence, looked
 men. criticism just: differences affect whole
 nature, not, plato supposes, confined single point.
 neither say far differences due education
 opinions mankind, physically inherited habits
 opinions former generations. women always taught,
 exactly slaves, inferior position,
 also supposed compensating advantages;
 position conformed. also true physical form may
 easily change course generations mode life;
 weakness delicacy, matter opinion, may become
 physical fact. characteristics sex vary greatly different
 countries ranks society, different ages
 individuals. plato may right denying
 ultimate difference sexes man exists
 animals, differences may conceived disappear
 states society, different circumstances life

 character proposals. first, may observe relations

 hope universal brotherhood may take place private
 interests--an aspiration which, although justified experience,
 possessed many noble minds. hand, sentiment

 hence must 'a marriage true minds' well bodies,
 imagination reason well lusts instincts. men women
 without feeling imagination justly called brutes; yet plato
 takes away qualities puts nothing place, even
 desire noble offspring, since parents know
 children. important transaction social life,
 idealist philosopher converts brutal. pair
 relation one another, except hymeneal festival;
 children theirs, state's; tie affection

 eminent physiologist thinks worth 'to try place life

 upon physical? higher comes first, lower, first
 human rational, afterwards animal. yet absolutely
 divided; times sickness moments self-indulgence
 seem different aspects common human nature
 includes both. neither moral limit physical,
 expansion enlargement it,--the highest form
 physical capable receiving. plato would say, body
 take care body, still less mind, mind takes
 care both. human action common man
 animals characteristic element, distinguishes

 virtue health body 'la facon que notre sang circule,' still
 merely physical grounds must come back ideas. mind reason

 cannot health body without health mind; health

 3. plato's views education several respects remarkable;
 like rest republic partly greek partly ideal,
 beginning ordinary curriculum greek youth, extending
 after-life. plato first writer distinctly says
 education comprehend whole life, preparation
 another education begins again. continuous
 thread runs republic,
 ideas admits application modern life.

 long given notion virtue cannot taught;
 disposed modify thesis protagoras, virtues
 one many. unwilling admit sensible world
 scheme truth. assert republic
 involuntariness vice, maintained timaeus,
 sophist, laws (protag., apol., gorg.). so-called platonic
 ideas recovered former state existence affect theory
 mental improvement. still observe remains old
 socratic doctrine, true knowledge must elicited within,
 sought ideas, particulars sense. education,
 says, implant principle intelligence better
 ten thousand eyes. paradox virtues one, kindred
 notion virtue knowledge, entirely renounced;
 first seen supremacy given justice rest;
 second tendency absorb moral virtues intellectual,
 centre goodness contemplation idea good.
 world sense still depreciated identified opinion, though
 admitted shadow true. republic evidently
 impressed conviction vice arises chiefly ignorance
 may cured education; multitude hardly deemed
 responsible do. faint allusion doctrine
 reminiscence occurs tenth book; plato's views education
 real connection previous state existence
 own; proposes elicit mind
 already. education represented him, filling
 vessel, turning eye soul towards light.

 treats first music literature, divides true
 false, goes gymnastics; infancy republic
 takes notice, though laws gives sage counsels
 nursing children management mothers, would
 education even prior birth. republic begins
 age child capable receiving ideas,
 boldly asserts, language sounds paradoxical modern ears,

 modern ancient philosophical world agreed truth
 falsehood; one identifies truth almost exclusively fact,
 ideas. difference plato,
 is, however, partly difference words. admit
 child must receive many lessons imperfectly understands;
 must taught things figure only,
 hardly expected believe grows older; limit
 use fiction necessity case. plato would draw
 line differently; according aim early education
 truth matter fact, truth matter principle; child
 taught first simple religious truths, simple moral
 truths, insensibly learn lesson good manners good
 taste. would make entire reformation old mythology; like
 xenophanes heracleitus sensible deep chasm

 imaginary authority, purposes. lusts
 treacheries gods banished; terrors world

 model youth. another strain heard homer
 may teach youth endurance; something may learnt
 medicine simple practice homeric age. principles
 religion based two only: first, god true;
 secondly, good. modern christian writers often
 fallen short these; hardly said gone beyond them.

 young brought happy surroundings, way
 sights sounds may hurt character vitiate taste.
 live atmosphere health; breeze always
 wafting impressions truth goodness. could
 education realized, modern religious education could
 bound truth virtue good manners good taste,
 would best hope human improvement. plato, like ourselves,
 looking forward changes moral religious world,
 preparing them. recognizes danger unsettling young men's
 minds sudden changes laws principles, destroying
 sacredness one set ideas nothing else take
 place. afraid influence drama, ground
 encourages false sentiment, therefore would
 children taken theatre; thinks effect
 spectators bad, actors still worse. idea education
 harmonious growth, insensibly learnt lessons
 temperance endurance, body mind develope equal
 proportions. first principle runs art nature
 simplicity; also rule human life.

 second stage education gymnastic, answers period
 muscular growth development. simplicity enforced
 music extended gymnastic; plato aware training
 body may inconsistent training mind, bodily
 exercise may easily overdone. excessive training body
 apt give men headache render sleepy lecture
 philosophy, attribute true cause,
 nature subject. two points noticeable plato's treatment
 gymnastic:--first, time training entirely separated
 time literary education. seems thought two things
 opposite different nature could learnt
 time. hardly agree him; and, may judge
 experience, effect spending three years ages
 fourteen seventeen mere bodily exercise would far
 improving intellect. secondly, affirms music
 gymnastic not, common opinion apt imagine, intended,
 one cultivation mind body,
 equally designed improvement mind.
 body, view, servant mind; subjection
 lower higher advantage both. doubtless
 mind may exercise great paramount influence body,
 exerted particular moments fits starts,
 continuously, making preparation whole life. greek
 writers saw mischievous tendency spartan discipline (arist. pol;
 thuc.). plato recognized fundamental error
 practice based.

 subject gymnastic leads plato sister subject medicine,
 illustrates parallel law. modern
 disbelief medicine led this, departments

 aware often make diseases 'greater complicated'

 slender progress; gained analysis parts

 them: whereas hegel thinking minds men one mind,

 different times country, plato gradations
 regarded order thought ideas; history human
 mind yet dawned upon him.

 many criticisms may made plato's theory education.
 respects unavoidably falls short modern thinkers, others
 advance them. opposed modes education
 prevailed time; hardly said discovered
 new ones. see education relative characters
 individuals; desires impress form state
 minds all. sufficient idea effect literature
 formation mind, greatly exaggerates
 mathematics. aim things train reasoning
 faculties; implant mind spirit power abstraction;
 explain define general notions, and, possible, connect
 them. wonder vacancy actual knowledge followers,

 modern language, doctrinaire; spartan fashion would

 strengthen develope character give play individual
 nature. citizens would acquired knowledge

 experience evil.

 hand, plato far advance modern philosophers
 theologians teaches education continued

 kind cease; although aware proverbial saying
 solon, 'i grow old learning many things,' cannot applied literally.
 ravished contemplation idea good,
 delighting solid geometry (rep.), difficulty imagining

 many men business world real students
 thinkers, equally sanguine. education proposes
 citizens really ideal life philosopher man

 yet thought plato may wholly incapable application

 may great effect elevating characters mankind,

 education life necessarily education
 one gives himself. men women cannot brought together schools

 call 'the den' whole life, content.
 neither teachers advisers take counsel

 one desirous carrying detail platonic education

 either one seems connect daily employment, or,
 perhaps, furnishes greatest contrast it. may study

 5. relation republic statesman laws,
 two works plato directly treat politics, see
 introductions two latter; general points comparison may
 touched upon place.

 first laws.

 (1) republic, though probably written intervals, yet speaking
 generally judging indications thought style, may
 reasonably ascribed middle period plato's life: laws
 certainly work declining years, portions
 rate seem written extreme old age.

 (2) republic full hope aspiration: laws bear stamp
 failure disappointment. one finished work received
 last touches author: imperfectly executed,
 apparently unfinished. one grace beauty youth:
 lost poetical form, severity
 knowledge life characteristic old age.

 (3) conspicuous defect laws failure dramatic
 power, whereas republic full striking contrasts ideas
 oppositions character.

 (4) laws may said nature sermon,
 republic poem; one religious,
 intellectual.

 (5) many theories plato, doctrine ideas,
 government world philosophers, found laws;
 immortality soul first mentioned xii; person
 socrates altogether disappeared. community women children
 renounced; institution common public meals women (laws)
 first time introduced (ar. pol.).

 (6) remains laws old enmity poets,
 ironically saluted high-flown terms, and, time,
 peremptorily ordered city, willing submit
 poems censorship magistrates (rep.).

 (7) though work respects inferior,
 passages laws, honour due soul, evils
 licentious unnatural love, whole book x. (religion),
 dishonesty retail trade, bequests, come home us,
 contain may termed modern element plato
 almost anything republic.

 relation two works one another well given:

 (1) aristotle politics side laws:--

 'the same, nearly same, objections apply plato's later work,
 laws, therefore better examine briefly constitution
 therein described. republic, socrates definitely
 settled questions only; community women
 children, community property, constitution state.
 population divided two classes--one husbandmen,
 warriors; latter taken third class
 counsellors rulers state. socrates determined
 whether husbandmen artists share
 government, whether carry arms share military
 service not. certainly thinks women ought share
 education guardians, fight side. remainder
 work filled digressions foreign main subject,
 discussions education guardians. laws
 hardly anything laws; much said constitution.
 this, intended make ordinary type,
 gradually brings round ideal form.
 exception community women property, supposes everything
 states; education;
 citizens live free servile occupations,
 common meals both. difference laws
 common meals extended women, warriors number
 5000, republic 1000.'

 (2) plato laws (book v.), side republic:--

 'the first highest form state government
 law prevails widely ancient saying
 "friends things common." whether now, ever
 be, communion women children property,
 private individual altogether banished life, things
 nature private, eyes ears hands,
 become common, men express praise blame, feel joy
 sorrow, occasions, laws unite city
 utmost,--whether possible not, say man, acting
 upon principle, ever constitute state exalted
 virtue, truer better this. state, whether inhabited
 gods sons gods, make blessed dwell therein;
 therefore look pattern state,
 cling this, and, far possible, seek one like
 this. state hand, created, nearest
 immortality unity next degree; that,
 grace god, complete third one. begin
 speaking nature origin second.'

 comparatively short work called statesman politicus
 style manner akin laws, idealism
 rather resembles republic. far judge various
 indications language thought, must later one
 course earlier other. republic statesman
 close connection maintained politics dialectic.
 statesman, enquiries principles method interspersed
 discussions politics. comparative advantages rule
 law person considered, decision given favour
 person (arist. pol.). much may said side,
 opposition necessary; person may rule law, law may

 republic, myth, describing, however, future,
 former existence mankind. question asked, 'whether state
 innocence described myth, state like
 possesses art science distinguishes good evil,
 preferable condition man.' question comparative
 happiness civilized primitive life, often discussed
 last century own, answer given. statesman,
 though less perfect style republic far less range,
 may justly regarded one greatest plato's dialogues.

 may ask, cephalus, whether fortune part

 consider greatest blessing reaped
 wealth?

 one, said, could expect easily convince others.
 let tell you, socrates, man thinks near
 death, fears cares enter mind never before;
 tales world punishment exacted
 deeds done laughing matter him,
 tormented thought may true: either
 weakness age, drawing nearer
 place, clearer view things; suspicions alarms
 crowd thickly upon him, begins reflect consider
 wrongs done others. finds sum
 transgressions great many time like child start
 sleep fear, filled dark forebodings.
 conscious sin, sweet hope, pindar charmingly says,
 kind nurse age:

 'hope,' says, 'cherishes soul lives justice
 holiness, nurse age companion
 journey;--hope mightiest sway restless soul man.'

 admirable words! great blessing riches,
 say every man, good man, is, occasion
 deceive defraud others, either intentionally unintentionally;
 departs world apprehension
 offerings due gods debts owes men.
 peace mind possession wealth greatly contributes;
 therefore say, that, setting one thing another, many
 advantages wealth give, man sense
 opinion greatest.

 well said, cephalus, replied; concerning justice,
 it?--to speak truth pay debts--no this?
 even exceptions? suppose friend
 right mind deposited arms asks
 right mind, ought give back him? one would
 say ought right so,
 would say ought always speak truth one
 condition.

 quite right, replied.

 then, said, speaking truth paying debts
 correct definition justice.

 quite correct, socrates, simonides believed, said
 polemarchus interposing.

 fear, said cephalus, must go now, look
 sacrifices, hand argument polemarchus company.

 polemarchus heir? said.

 sure, answered, went away laughing sacrifices.

 tell then, thou heir argument, simonides say,
 according truly say, justice?

 said repayment debt just, saying
 appears right.

 sorry doubt word wise inspired man,
 meaning, though probably clear you, reverse clear
 me. certainly mean, saying,
 ought return deposit arms anything else one asks
 right senses; yet deposit cannot
 denied debt.

 true.

 person asks right mind
 means make return?

 certainly not.

 simonides said repayment debt justice,
 mean include case?

 certainly not; thinks friend ought always good
 friend never evil.

 mean return deposit gold injury
 receiver, two parties friends, repayment
 debt,--that would imagine say?

 yes.

 enemies also receive owe them?

 sure, said, receive owe them, enemy,
 take it, owes enemy due proper him--that
 say, evil.

 simonides, then, manner poets, would seem spoken
 darkly nature justice; really meant say justice
 giving man proper him, termed
 debt.

 must meaning, said.

 heaven! replied; asked due proper thing
 given medicine, whom, answer think would
 make us?

 would surely reply medicine gives drugs meat drink
 human bodies.

 due proper thing given cookery, what?

 seasoning food.

 justice gives, whom?

 if, socrates, guided analogy preceding
 instances, justice art gives good friends evil
 enemies.

 meaning then?

 think so.

 best able good friends evil enemies
 time sickness?

 physician.

 voyage, amid perils sea?

 pilot.

 sort actions view result
 man able harm enemy good friend?

 going war one making alliances other.

 man well, dear polemarchus, need
 physician?

 no.

 voyage need pilot?

 no.

 time peace justice use?

 far thinking so.

 think justice may use peace well war?

 yes.

 like husbandry acquisition corn?

 yes.

 like shoemaking acquisition shoes,--that mean?

 yes.

 similar use power acquisition justice time
 peace?

 contracts, socrates, justice use.

 contracts mean partnerships?

 exactly.

 man skilful player useful better
 partner game draughts?

 skilful player.

 laying bricks stones man useful
 better partner builder?

 quite reverse.

 sort partnership man better partner
 harp-player, playing harp harp-player certainly
 better partner man?

 money partnership.

 yes, polemarchus, surely use money;
 want man counsellor purchase sale
 horse; man knowing horses would better that, would
 not?

 certainly.

 want buy ship, shipwright pilot would
 better?

 true.

 joint use silver gold man
 preferred?

 want deposit kept safely.

 mean money wanted, allowed lie?

 precisely.

 say, justice useful money useless?

 inference.

 want keep pruning-hook safe, justice useful
 individual state; want use it,
 art vine-dresser?

 clearly.

 want keep shield lyre, use them,
 would say justice useful; want use them,
 art soldier musician?

 certainly.

 things;--justice useful useless,
 useless useful?

 inference.

 justice good much. let us consider
 point: best strike blow boxing match
 kind fighting best able ward blow?

 certainly.

 skilful preventing escaping disease
 best able create one?

 true.

 best guard camp best able steal march
 upon enemy?

 certainly.

 good keeper anything also good thief?

 that, suppose, inferred.

 man good keeping money, good stealing
 it.

 implied argument.

 man turned thief.
 lesson suspect must learnt homer; he,
 speaking autolycus, maternal grandfather odysseus,
 favourite his, affirms

 'he excellent men theft perjury.'

 so, homer simonides agreed justice art
 theft; practised however 'for good friends harm
 enemies,'--that saying?

 no, certainly that, though know say;
 still stand latter words.

 well, another question: friends enemies mean
 really, seeming?

 surely, said, man may expected love thinks
 good, hate thinks evil.

 yes, persons often err good evil: many
 good seem so, conversely?

 true.

 good enemies evil
 friends? true.

 case right good evil evil
 good?

 clearly.

 good would injustice?

 true.

 according argument injure
 wrong?

 nay, socrates; doctrine immoral.

 suppose ought good harm
 unjust?

 like better.

 see consequence:--many man ignorant human nature
 friends bad friends, case ought harm
 them; good enemies ought benefit; but, so,
 shall saying opposite affirmed
 meaning simonides.

 true, said: think better correct error
 seem fallen use words 'friend'
 'enemy.'

 error, polemarchus? asked.

 assumed friend seems thought good.

 error corrected?

 rather say friend is, well seems, good;
 seems only, good, seems
 friend; enemy may said.

 would argue good friends bad enemies?

 yes.

 instead saying simply first,
 good friends harm enemies, say:
 good friends good harm
 enemies evil?

 yes, appears truth.

 ought injure one all?

 undoubtedly ought injure wicked
 enemies.

 horses injured, improved deteriorated?

 latter.

 deteriorated, say, good qualities horses,
 dogs?

 yes, horses.

 dogs deteriorated good qualities dogs,
 horses?

 course.

 men injured deteriorated
 proper virtue man?

 certainly.

 human virtue justice?

 sure.

 men injured necessity made unjust?

 result.

 musician art make men unmusical?

 certainly not.

 horseman art make bad horsemen?

 impossible.

 justice make men unjust, speaking generally,
 good virtue make bad?

 assuredly not.

 heat produce cold?

 cannot.

 drought moisture?

 clearly not.

 good harm one?

 impossible.

 good?

 certainly.

 injure friend one else act man,
 opposite, unjust?

 think say quite true, socrates.

 man says justice consists repayment debts,
 good debt man owes friends, evil
 debt owes enemies,--to say wise;
 true, if, clearly shown, injuring another
 case just.

 agree you, said polemarchus.

 prepared take arms one
 attributes saying simonides bias pittacus,
 wise man seer?

 quite ready battle side, said.

 shall tell whose believe saying be?

 whose?

 believe periander perdiccas xerxes ismenias theban,
 rich mighty man, great opinion
 power, first say justice 'doing good friends
 harm enemies.'

 true, said.

 yes, said; definition justice also breaks down,
 offered?

 several times course discussion thrasymachus made
 attempt get argument hands, put
 rest company, wanted hear end.
 polemarchus done speaking pause, could
 longer hold peace; and, gathering up, came us like
 wild beast, seeking devour us. quite panic-stricken
 sight him.

 roared whole company: folly, socrates, taken
 possession all? why, sillybillies, knock
 one another? say want really know justice is,
 ask answer, seek honour
 refutation opponent, answer;
 many one ask cannot answer.
 say justice duty advantage profit gain
 interest, sort nonsense me; must
 clearness accuracy.

 panic-stricken words, could look without
 trembling. indeed believe fixed eye upon him,
 struck dumb: saw fury rising, looked
 first, therefore able reply him.

 thrasymachus, said, quiver, hard upon us. polemarchus
 may guilty little mistake argument,
 assure error intentional. seeking
 piece gold, would imagine 'knocking
 one another,' losing chance finding it. why,
 seeking justice, thing precious many pieces
 gold, say weakly yielding one another
 utmost get truth? nay, good friend,
 willing anxious so, fact cannot. so,
 people know things pity us angry us.

 characteristic socrates! replied, bitter laugh;--that's
 ironical style! foresee--have already told you,
 whatever asked would refuse answer, try irony
 shuffle, order might avoid answering?

 philosopher, thrasymachus, replied, well know
 ask person numbers make twelve, taking care prohibit
 ask answering twice six, three times four, six
 times two, four times three, 'for sort nonsense
 me,'--then obviously, way putting
 question, one answer you. suppose retort,
 'thrasymachus, mean? one numbers
 interdict true answer question, falsely say
 number right one?--is meaning?'--how
 would answer him?

 two cases alike! said.

 be? replied; even not,
 appear person asked, ought say
 thinks, whether forbid not?

 presume going make one interdicted
 answers?

 dare say may, notwithstanding danger, upon reflection
 approve them.

 give answer justice better,
 said, these? deserve done you?

 done me!--as becomes ignorant, must learn wise--that
 deserve done me.

 what, payment! pleasant notion!

 pay money, replied.

 have, socrates, said glaucon: you, thrasymachus, need
 anxiety money, make contribution
 socrates.

 yes, replied, socrates always does--refuse
 answer himself, take pull pieces answer one else.

 why, good friend, said, one answer knows, says
 knows, nothing; who, even faint notions
 own, told man authority utter them?
 natural thing is, speaker one like
 professes know tell knows. kindly
 answer, edification company myself?

 glaucon rest company joined request,
 thrasymachus, one might see, reality eager speak;
 thought excellent answer, would distinguish
 himself. first affected insist answering; length
 consented begin. behold, said, wisdom socrates;
 refuses teach himself, goes learning others,
 never even says thank you.

 learn others, replied, quite true;
 ungrateful wholly deny. money none, therefore pay
 praise, have; ready praise one
 appears speak well soon find answer;
 expect answer well.

 listen, then, said; proclaim justice nothing else
 interest stronger. praise me?
 course won't.

 let first understand you, replied. justice, say,
 interest stronger. what, thrasymachus, meaning this?
 cannot mean say polydamas, pancratiast,
 stronger are, finds eating beef conducive
 bodily strength, eat beef therefore equally good
 weaker is, right us?

 that's abominable you, socrates; take words sense
 damaging argument.

 all, good sir, said; trying understand them;
 wish would little clearer.

 well, said, never heard forms government differ;
 tyrannies, democracies,
 aristocracies?

 yes, know.

 government ruling power state?

 certainly.

 different forms government make laws democratical,
 aristocratical, tyrannical, view several interests;
 laws, made interests,
 justice deliver subjects, transgresses
 punish breaker law, unjust.
 mean say states principle
 justice, interest government; government
 must supposed power, reasonable conclusion is,
 everywhere one principle justice, interest
 stronger.

 understand you, said; whether right
 try discover. let remark, defining justice
 used word 'interest' forbade use.
 true, however, definition words 'of stronger'
 added.

 small addition, must allow, said.

 great small, never mind that: must first enquire whether
 saying truth. agreed justice
 interest sort, go say 'of stronger';
 addition sure, must therefore consider further.

 proceed.

 will; first tell me, admit subjects
 obey rulers?

 do.

 rulers states absolutely infallible,
 sometimes liable err?

 sure, replied, liable err.

 making laws may sometimes make rightly,
 sometimes not?

 true.

 make rightly, make agreeably interest;
 mistaken, contrary interest; admit that?

 yes.

 laws make must obeyed subjects,--and
 call justice?

 doubtless.

 justice, according argument, obedience
 interest stronger reverse?

 saying? asked.

 repeating saying, believe. let us consider:
 admitted rulers may mistaken
 interest command, also obey justice?
 admitted?

 yes.

 must also acknowledged justice interest
 stronger, rulers unintentionally command things
 done injury. if, say, justice
 obedience subject renders commands, case,
 wisest men, escape conclusion weaker
 commanded do, interest,
 injury stronger?

 nothing clearer, socrates, said polemarchus.

 yes, said cleitophon, interposing, allowed witness.

 need witness, said polemarchus, thrasymachus
 acknowledges rulers may sometimes command
 interest, subjects obey justice.

 yes, polemarchus,--thrasymachus said subjects
 commanded rulers just.

 yes, cleitophon, also said justice interest
 stronger, and, admitting propositions,
 acknowledged stronger may command weaker
 subjects interest; whence follows
 justice injury quite much interest stronger.

 but, said cleitophon, meant interest stronger
 stronger thought interest,--this weaker
 do; affirmed justice.

 words, rejoined polemarchus.

 never mind, replied, says are, let us accept
 statement. tell me, thrasymachus, said, mean justice
 stronger thought interest, whether really not?

 certainly not, said. suppose call mistaken
 stronger time mistaken?

 yes, said, impression so, admitted
 ruler infallible might sometimes mistaken.

 argue like informer, socrates. mean, example,
 mistaken sick physician mistaken?
 errs arithmetic grammar arithmetician
 grammarian time making mistake, respect
 mistake? true, say physician arithmetician grammarian
 made mistake, way speaking; fact
 neither grammarian person skill ever makes
 mistake far name implies; none
 err unless skill fails them, cease skilled
 artists. artist sage ruler errs time
 name implies; though commonly said err, adopted
 common mode speaking. perfectly accurate, since
 lover accuracy, say ruler, far
 ruler, unerring, and, unerring, always commands
 interest; subject required execute
 commands; therefore, said first repeat, justice
 interest stronger.

 indeed, thrasymachus, really appear argue like
 informer?

 certainly, replied.

 suppose ask questions design
 injuring argument?

 nay, replied, 'suppose' word--i know it;
 found out, sheer force argument never prevail.

 shall make attempt, dear man; avoid
 misunderstanding occurring us future, let ask,
 sense speak ruler stronger whose interest,
 saying, superior, inferior
 execute--is ruler popular strict sense
 term?

 strictest senses, said. cheat play
 informer can; ask quarter hands. never
 able, never.

 imagine, said, madman try cheat,
 thrasymachus? might well shave lion.

 why, said, made attempt minute ago, failed.

 enough, said, civilities. better ask
 question: physician, taken strict sense
 speaking, healer sick maker money? remember
 speaking true physician.

 healer sick, replied.

 pilot--that say, true pilot--is captain
 sailors mere sailor?

 captain sailors.

 circumstance sails ship taken
 account; neither called sailor; name pilot
 distinguished nothing sailing, significant
 skill authority sailors.

 true, said.

 now, said, every art interest?

 certainly.

 art consider provide?

 yes, aim art.

 interest art perfection it--this nothing
 else?

 mean?

 mean may illustrate negatively example body.
 suppose ask whether body self-sufficing
 wants, reply: certainly body wants; body may
 ill require cured, therefore interests
 art medicine ministers; origin intention
 medicine, acknowledge. right?

 quite right, replied.

 art medicine art faulty deficient
 quality way eye may deficient sight
 ear fail hearing, therefore requires another art provide
 interests seeing hearing--has art itself, say,
 similar liability fault defect, every art require another
 supplementary art provide interests, another
 another without end? arts look
 interests? need either
 another?--having faults defects, need correct
 them, either exercise art other;
 consider interest subject-matter. every art
 remains pure faultless remaining true--that say,
 perfect unimpaired. take words precise sense, tell
 whether right.

 yes, clearly.

 medicine consider interest medicine,
 interest body?

 true, said.

 art horsemanship consider interests art
 horsemanship, interests horse; neither arts
 care themselves, needs; care
 subject art?

 true, said.

 surely, thrasymachus, arts superiors rulers
 subjects?

 assented good deal reluctance.

 then, said, science art considers enjoins interest
 stronger superior, interest subject weaker?

 made attempt contest proposition also, finally
 acquiesced.

 then, continued, physician, far physician,
 considers good prescribes, good
 patient; true physician also ruler human body
 subject, mere money-maker; admitted?

 yes.

 pilot likewise, strict sense term, ruler
 sailors mere sailor?

 admitted.

 pilot ruler provide prescribe interest
 sailor him, ruler's
 interest?

 gave reluctant 'yes.'

 then, said, thrasymachus, one rule who, far
 ruler, considers enjoins interest,
 always interest subject suitable art;
 looks, alone considers everything
 says does.

 got point argument, every one saw
 definition justice completely upset, thrasymachus,
 instead replying me, said: tell me, socrates, got
 nurse?

 ask question, said, ought rather
 answering?

 leaves snivel, never wipes nose:
 even taught know shepherd sheep.

 makes say that? replied.

 fancy shepherd neatherd fattens tends
 sheep oxen view good good
 master; imagine rulers
 states, true rulers, never think subjects sheep,
 studying advantage day night. oh,
 no; entirely astray ideas
 unjust even know justice reality
 another's good; say, interest ruler stronger,
 loss subject servant; injustice opposite;
 unjust lord truly simple just: stronger,
 subjects interest, minister
 happiness, far own. consider further,
 foolish socrates, always loser comparison
 unjust. first all, private contracts: wherever unjust
 partner find that, partnership
 dissolved, unjust man always less. secondly,
 dealings state: income-tax,
 man pay unjust less amount income;
 anything received one gains nothing
 much. observe also happens take office;
 man neglecting affairs perhaps suffering losses,
 getting nothing public, just; moreover
 hated friends acquaintance refusing serve
 unlawful ways. reversed case unjust man.
 speaking, before, injustice large scale
 advantage unjust apparent; meaning
 clearly seen turn highest form injustice
 criminal happiest men, sufferers refuse
 injustice miserable--that say tyranny,
 fraud force takes away property others, little little
 wholesale; comprehending one, things sacred well profane,
 private public; acts wrong, detected
 perpetrating one singly, would punished incur
 great disgrace--they wrong particular cases called
 robbers temples, man-stealers burglars swindlers
 thieves. man besides taking away money citizens
 made slaves them, then, instead names reproach,
 termed happy blessed, citizens
 hear achieved consummation injustice. mankind
 censure injustice, fearing may victims
 shrink committing it. thus, shown,
 socrates, injustice, sufficient scale, strength
 freedom mastery justice; and, said first, justice
 interest stronger, whereas injustice man's profit
 interest.

 thrasymachus, thus spoken, having, like bath-man, deluged
 ears words, mind go away. company
 would let him; insisted remain defend
 position; added humble request would
 leave us. thrasymachus, said him, excellent man, suggestive
 remarks! going run away fairly
 taught learned whether true not? attempt
 determine way man's life small matter eyes--to
 determine life may passed one us greatest
 advantage?

 differ you, said, importance enquiry?

 appear rather, replied, care thought us,
 thrasymachus--whether live better worse knowing
 say know, matter indifference. prithee, friend,
 keep knowledge yourself; large party;
 benefit confer upon us amply rewarded.
 part openly declare convinced, believe
 injustice gainful justice, even uncontrolled
 allowed free play. for, granting may unjust
 man able commit injustice either fraud force, still
 convince superior advantage injustice,
 may others predicament myself. perhaps
 may wrong; so, wisdom convince us
 mistaken preferring justice injustice.

 convince you, said, already convinced
 said; you? would
 put proof bodily souls?

 heaven forbid! said; would ask consistent; or,
 change, change openly let deception. must remark,
 thrasymachus, recall previously said, although
 began defining true physician exact sense,
 observe like exactness speaking shepherd; thought
 shepherd shepherd tends sheep view
 good, like mere diner banquetter view pleasures
 table; or, again, trader sale market,
 shepherd. yet surely art shepherd concerned
 good subjects; provide best them,
 since perfection art already ensured whenever
 requirements satisfied. saying
 ruler. conceived art ruler, considered
 ruler, whether state private life, could regard
 good flock subjects; whereas seem think rulers
 states, say, true rulers, like authority.

 think! nay, sure it.

 case lesser offices men never take willingly
 without payment, unless idea govern
 advantage others? let ask question:
 several arts different, reason
 separate function? and, dear illustrious friend, say
 think, may make little progress.

 yes, difference, replied.

 art gives us particular good merely general
 one--medicine, example, gives us health; navigation, safety sea,
 on?

 yes, said.

 art payment special function giving pay:
 confuse arts, art pilot
 confused art medicine, health pilot
 may improved sea voyage. would inclined say, would
 you, navigation art medicine, least adopt
 exact use language?

 certainly not.

 man good health receives pay would
 say art payment medicine?

 not.

 would say medicine art receiving pay
 man takes fees engaged healing?

 certainly not.

 admitted, said, good art specially
 confined art?

 yes.

 then, good artists common,
 attributed something common use?

 true, replied.

 artist benefited receiving pay advantage
 gained additional use art pay, art
 professed him?

 gave reluctant assent this.

 pay derived several artists respective
 arts. truth is, art medicine gives health,
 art builder builds house, another art attends
 art pay. various arts may business
 benefiting preside, would artist receive
 benefit art unless paid well?

 suppose not.

 therefore confer benefit works nothing?

 certainly, confers benefit.

 now, thrasymachus, longer doubt neither arts
 governments provide interests; but,
 saying, rule provide interests subjects
 weaker stronger--to good attend
 good superior. reason, dear
 thrasymachus, why, saying, one willing
 govern; one likes take hand reformation evils
 concern without remuneration. for, execution
 work, giving orders another, true artist
 regard interest, always subjects; therefore
 order rulers may willing rule, must paid one
 three modes payment, money, honour, penalty refusing.

 mean, socrates? said glaucon. first two modes payment
 intelligible enough, penalty understand,
 penalty payment.

 mean understand nature payment
 best men great inducement rule? course know
 ambition avarice held be, indeed are, disgrace?

 true.

 reason, said, money honour attraction
 them; good men wish openly demanding payment governing
 get name hirelings, secretly helping
 public revenues get name thieves.
 ambitious care honour. wherefore necessity must
 laid upon them, must induced serve fear
 punishment. this, imagine, reason forwardness
 take office, instead waiting compelled, deemed
 dishonourable. worst part punishment
 refuses rule liable ruled one worse himself.
 fear this, conceive, induces good take office,
 would, cannot help--not idea
 going benefit enjoyment themselves,
 necessity, able commit task ruling
 one better themselves, indeed good.
 reason think city composed entirely good men,
 avoid office would much object contention
 obtain office present; plain proof
 true ruler meant nature regard interest,
 subjects; every one knew would choose rather
 receive benefit another trouble conferring
 one. far agreeing thrasymachus justice
 interest stronger. latter question need
 discussed present; thrasymachus says life
 unjust advantageous just, new statement
 appears far serious character. us
 spoken truly? sort life, glaucon, prefer?

 part deem life advantageous,
 answered.

 hear advantages unjust thrasymachus
 rehearsing?

 yes, heard him, replied, convinced me.

 shall try find way convincing him, can,
 saying true?

 certainly, replied.

 if, said, makes set speech make another recounting
 advantages just, answers rejoin, must
 numbering measuring goods claimed either side,
 end shall want judges decide; proceed
 enquiry lately did, making admissions one another, shall
 unite offices judge advocate persons.

 good, said.

 method understand prefer? said.

 propose.

 well, then, thrasymachus, said, suppose begin beginning
 answer me. say perfect injustice gainful perfect
 justice?

 yes, say, given reasons.

 view them? would call one virtue
 vice?

 certainly.

 suppose would call justice virtue injustice vice?

 charming notion! likely too, seeing affirm injustice
 profitable justice not.

 else would say?

 opposite, replied.

 would call justice vice?

 no, would rather say sublime simplicity.

 would call injustice malignity?

 no; would rather say discretion.

 unjust appear wise good?

 yes, said; rate able perfectly
 unjust, power subduing states nations;
 perhaps imagine talking cutpurses. even profession
 undetected advantages, though compared
 speaking.

 think misapprehend meaning, thrasymachus,
 replied; still cannot hear without amazement class
 injustice wisdom virtue, justice opposite.

 certainly class them.

 now, said, substantial almost unanswerable ground;
 injustice maintaining profitable
 admitted others vice deformity, answer
 might given received principles; perceive
 call injustice honourable strong, unjust
 attribute qualities attributed us
 just, seeing hesitate rank injustice
 wisdom virtue.

 guessed infallibly, replied.

 certainly ought shrink going
 argument long reason think you, thrasymachus,
 speaking real mind; believe earnest
 amusing expense.

 may earnest not, you?--to refute
 argument business.

 true, said; do: good
 answer yet one question? man try gain
 advantage just?

 far otherwise; would simple amusing creature
 is.

 would try go beyond action?

 would not.

 would regard attempt gain advantage
 unjust; would considered unjust?

 would think just, would try gain advantage;
 would able.

 whether would would able, said, point.
 question whether man, refusing
 another man, would wish claim unjust?

 yes, would.

 unjust--does claim man
 just?

 course, said, claims men.

 unjust man strive struggle obtain
 unjust man action, order may all?

 true.

 may put matter thus, said--the desire
 like unlike, whereas unjust desires
 like unlike?

 nothing, said, better statement.

 unjust good wise, neither?

 good again, said.

 unjust like wise good unlike them?

 course, said, certain nature, like
 certain nature; not, not.

 them, said, like is?

 certainly, replied.

 good, thrasymachus, said; take case arts:
 would admit one man musician another musician?

 yes.

 wise foolish?

 clearly musician wise, musician foolish.

 good far wise, bad far
 foolish?

 yes.

 would say sort thing physician?

 yes.

 think, excellent friend, musician adjusts
 lyre would desire claim exceed go beyond musician
 tightening loosening strings?

 think would.

 would claim exceed non-musician?

 course.

 would say physician? prescribing meats drinks
 would wish go beyond another physician beyond practice
 medicine?

 would not.

 would wish go beyond non-physician?

 yes.

 knowledge ignorance general; see whether think
 man knowledge ever would wish choice saying
 another man knowledge. would rather
 say like case?

 that, suppose, hardly denied.

 ignorant? would desire either
 knowing ignorant?

 dare say.

 knowing wise?

 yes.

 wise good?

 true.

 wise good desire gain like,
 unlike opposite?

 suppose so.

 whereas bad ignorant desire gain both?

 yes.

 say, thrasymachus, unjust goes beyond
 like unlike? words?

 were.

 also said go beyond like
 unlike?

 yes.

 like wise good, unjust like evil
 ignorant?

 inference.

 like is?

 admitted.

 turned wise good unjust evil
 ignorant.

 thrasymachus made admissions, fluently, repeat
 them, extreme reluctance; hot summer's day,
 perspiration poured torrents; saw
 never seen before, thrasymachus blushing. agreed
 justice virtue wisdom, injustice vice ignorance,
 proceeded another point:

 well, said, thrasymachus, matter settled;
 also saying injustice strength; remember?

 yes, remember, said, suppose approve
 saying answer; however answer, would
 quite certain accuse haranguing; therefore either permit
 say out, would rather ask, so, answer
 'very good,' say story-telling old women, nod 'yes'
 'no.'

 certainly not, said, contrary real opinion.

 yes, said, will, please you, since let speak.
 else would have?

 nothing world, said; disposed ask
 shall answer.

 proceed.

 repeat question asked before, order
 examination relative nature justice injustice may
 carried regularly. statement made injustice stronger
 powerful justice, justice, identified
 wisdom virtue, easily shown stronger injustice,
 injustice ignorance; longer questioned one.
 want view matter, thrasymachus, different way:
 would deny state may unjust may unjustly attempting
 enslave states, may already enslaved them, may
 holding many subjection?

 true, replied; add best perfectly unjust
 state likely so.

 know, said, position; would
 consider is, whether power possessed superior state
 exist exercised without justice justice.

 right view, justice wisdom,
 justice; right, without justice.

 delighted, thrasymachus, see nodding assent
 dissent, making answers quite excellent.

 civility you, replied.

 kind, said; would goodness also
 inform me, whether think state, army, band
 robbers thieves, gang evil-doers could act
 injured one another?

 indeed, said, could not.

 abstained injuring one another, might act
 together better?

 yes.

 injustice creates divisions hatreds
 fighting, justice imparts harmony friendship; true,
 thrasymachus?

 agree, said, wish quarrel you.

 good you, said; like know also whether
 injustice, tendency arouse hatred, wherever existing,
 among slaves among freemen, make hate one another
 set variance render incapable common action?

 certainly.

 even injustice found two only, quarrel
 fight, become enemies one another just?

 will.

 suppose injustice abiding single person, would wisdom say
 loses retains natural power?

 let us assume retains power.

 yet power injustice exercises nature
 wherever takes abode, whether city, army,
 family, body, body is, begin with, rendered
 incapable united action reason sedition distraction;
 become enemy variance opposes
 it, just? case?

 yes, certainly.

 injustice equally fatal existing single person;
 first place rendering incapable action
 unity himself, second place making enemy
 just? true, thrasymachus?

 yes.

 friend, said, surely gods just?

 granted are.

 so, unjust enemy gods,
 friend?

 feast away triumph, take fill argument;
 oppose you, lest displease company.

 well then, proceed answers, let remainder
 repast. already shown clearly wiser
 better abler unjust, unjust incapable
 common action; nay more, speak men evil
 acting time vigorously together, strictly true,
 perfectly evil, would laid hands upon one
 another; evident must remnant
 justice them, enabled combine;
 would injured one another well victims;
 half-villains enterprises; whole
 villains, utterly unjust, would utterly incapable

 glaucon, always pugnacious men, dissatisfied
 thrasymachus' retirement; wanted battle out. said
 me: socrates, wish really persuade us, seem

 indeed do; imagine theme man sense

 delighted, replied, hear say so, shall begin
 speaking, proposed, nature origin justice.

 say injustice is, nature, good; suffer injustice,
 evil; evil greater good. men
 done suffered injustice experience both,
 able avoid one obtain other, think
 better agree among neither; hence arise
 laws mutual covenants; ordained law termed
 lawful just. affirm origin nature

 enough this.

 now, form real judgment life

 therefore say perfectly unjust man must assume

 best, said. know like
 difficulty tracing sort life awaits either

 description little coarse, ask suppose, socrates,
 words follow mine.--let put mouths
 eulogists injustice: tell man
 thought unjust scourged, racked, bound--will eyes
 burnt out; and, last, suffering every kind evil,
 impaled: understand ought seem only,
 be, just; words aeschylus may truly spoken unjust
 just. unjust pursuing reality; live
 view appearances--he wants really unjust seem
 only:--

 'his mind soil deep fertile, spring prudent

 first place, thought just, therefore bears rule
 city; marry will, give marriage
 will; also trade deal likes, always
 advantage, misgivings injustice; every
 contest, whether public private, gets better
 antagonists, gains expense, rich,
 gains benefit friends, harm enemies; moreover,
 offer sacrifices, dedicate gifts gods abundantly
 magnificently, honour gods man wants
 honour far better style just, therefore likely
 dearer gods. thus, socrates, gods men
 said unite making life unjust better life
 just.

 going say something answer glaucon, adeimantus,
 brother, interposed: socrates, said, suppose
 nothing urged?

 why, else there? answered.

 strongest point even mentioned, replied.

 well, then, according proverb, 'let brother help brother'--if
 fails part assist him; although must confess
 glaucon already said quite enough lay dust, take
 power helping justice.

 nonsense, replied. let add something more: another
 side glaucon's argument praise censure justice
 injustice, equally required order bring
 believe meaning. parents tutors always telling
 sons wards just; why? sake
 justice, sake character reputation; hope
 obtaining reputed offices, marriages,
 like glaucon enumerated among advantages accruing
 unjust reputation justice. more, however, made
 appearances class persons others;
 throw good opinion gods, tell shower
 benefits heavens, say, rain upon pious;
 accords testimony noble hesiod homer, first
 says, gods make oaks just--

 'to bear acorns summit, bees middle;
 sheep bowed weight fleeces,'

 many blessings like kind provided them. homer
 similar strain; speaks one whose fame is--

 'as fame blameless king who, like god, maintains justice;
 black earth brings forth wheat barley, whose trees
 bowed fruit, sheep never fail bear, sea gives
 fish.'

 still grander gifts heaven musaeus son

 more, socrates, ask consider another way speaking
 justice injustice, confined poets,
 found prose writers. universal voice mankind always
 declaring justice virtue honourable, grievous
 toilsome; pleasures vice injustice easy
 attainment, censured law opinion. say also
 honesty part less profitable dishonesty;
 quite ready call wicked men happy, honour
 public private rich way influential,
 despise overlook may weak poor, even
 though acknowledging better others.
 extraordinary mode speaking virtue
 gods: say gods apportion calamity misery many good
 men, good happiness wicked. mendicant prophets go
 rich men's doors persuade power committed
 gods making atonement man's
 ancestor's sins sacrifices charms, rejoicings feasts;
 promise harm enemy, whether unjust, small cost;
 magic arts incantations binding heaven, say, execute
 will. poets authorities appeal,
 smoothing path vice words hesiod;--

 'vice may abundance without trouble; way smooth
 dwelling-place near. virtue gods set toil,'

 tedious uphill road: citing homer witness
 gods may influenced men; also says:--

 'the gods, too, may turned purpose; men pray
 avert wrath sacrifices soothing entreaties,
 libations odour fat, sinned transgressed.'

 say--according perform ritual, persuade

 equally service living dead; latter sort
 call mysteries, redeem us pains hell,
 neglect one knows awaits us.

 proceeded: young hear said virtue

 likely affected, dear socrates,--those them, mean,
 quickwitted, and, like bees wing, light every flower,
 hear prone draw conclusions manner

 'can justice crooked ways deceit ascend loftier tower

 nevertheless, argument indicates this, would happy,

 gods? or, suppose care human

 gods, care us, yet know
 tradition genealogies poets;
 persons say may influenced turned 'sacrifices

 believe neither. poets speak truly,

 just, although may escape vengeance heaven, shall lose

 cause this, socrates, indicated us beginning

 must frankly confess you, want hear

 unless take away true reputation

 glaucon rest entreated means let question
 drop, proceed investigation. wanted arrive
 truth, first, nature justice injustice, secondly,
 relative advantages. told them, really thought,
 enquiry would serious nature, would require
 good eyes. seeing then, said, great wits, think
 better adopt method may illustrate thus; suppose
 short-sighted person asked one read small letters

 found another place larger letters
 larger--if could read larger letters
 first, proceed lesser--this would thought
 rare piece good fortune.

 true, said adeimantus; illustration apply
 enquiry?

 tell you, replied; justice, subject
 enquiry, is, know, sometimes spoken virtue
 individual, sometimes virtue state.

 true, replied.

 state larger individual?

 is.

 larger quantity justice likely larger

 nature justice injustice, first appear state,
 secondly individual, proceeding greater lesser

 that, said, excellent proposal.

 imagine state process creation, shall see

 dare say.

 state completed may hope object

 yes, far easily.

 ought attempt construct one? said; so,
 inclined think, serious task. reflect therefore.

 reflected, said adeimantus, anxious
 proceed.

 state, said, arises, conceive, needs mankind;
 one self-sufficing, us many wants.
 origin state imagined?

 other.

 then, many wants, many persons needed supply them,
 one takes helper one purpose another another;
 partners helpers gathered together one habitation
 body inhabitants termed state.

 true, said.

 exchange one another, one gives, another receives,
 idea exchange good.

 true.

 then, said, let us begin create idea state; yet true
 creator necessity, mother invention.

 course, replied.

 first greatest necessities food,
 condition life existence.

 certainly.

 second dwelling, third clothing like.

 true.

 let us see city able supply great
 demand: may suppose one man husbandman, another builder,
 one else weaver--shall add shoemaker, perhaps
 purveyor bodily wants?

 quite right.

 barest notion state must include four five men.

 clearly.

 proceed? bring result labours
 common stock?--the individual husbandman, example, producing
 four, labouring four times long much need
 provision food supplies others well himself;
 nothing others trouble
 producing them, provide alone fourth food
 fourth time, remaining three fourths time
 employed making house coat pair shoes,
 partnership others, supplying wants?

 adeimantus thought aim producing food
 producing everything.

 probably, replied, would better way; hear
 say this, reminded alike;
 diversities natures among us adapted different
 occupations.

 true.

 work better done workman many
 occupations, one?

 one.

 further, doubt work spoilt done

 doubt.

 business disposed wait doer business

 business first object.

 must.

 so, must infer things produced plentifully
 easily better quality one man one thing
 natural right time, leaves things.

 undoubtedly.

 four citizens required; husbandman

 little state, already beginning grow?

 true.

 yet even add neatherds, shepherds, herdsmen, order
 husbandmen may oxen plough with, builders well
 husbandmen may draught cattle, curriers weavers fleeces

 true; yet neither small state contains
 these.

 then, again, situation city--to find place
 nothing need imported wellnigh impossible.

 impossible.

 must another class citizens bring required

 must.

 trader goes empty-handed, nothing require

 certain.

 therefore produce home must enough

 true.

 husbandmen artisans required?

 will.

 mention importers exporters, called merchants?

 yes.

 shall want merchants?

 shall.

 merchandise carried sea, skilful sailors

 yes, considerable numbers.

 then, again, within city, exchange productions?
 secure exchange was, remember, one
 principal objects formed society constituted

 clearly buy sell.

 need market-place, money-token purposes

 certainly.

 suppose husbandman, artisan, brings production

 all; find people who, seeing want, undertake
 office salesmen. well-ordered states commonly

 want, then, creates class retail-traders state.
 'retailer' term applied sit

 yes, said.

 another class servants, intellectually hardly

 true.

 hirelings help make population?

 yes.

 now, adeimantus, state matured perfected?

 think so.

 where, then, justice, injustice, part
 state spring up?

 probably dealings citizens one another. cannot
 imagine likely found else.

 dare say right suggestion, said; better
 think matter out, shrink enquiry.

 let us consider, first all, way life,
 thus established them. produce corn,
 wine, clothes, shoes, build houses themselves?
 housed, work, summer, commonly, stripped
 barefoot, winter substantially clothed shod. feed
 barley-meal flour wheat, baking kneading them, making
 noble cakes loaves; serve mat reeds
 clean leaves, reclining upon beds strewn yew
 myrtle. children feast, drinking wine
 made, wearing garlands heads, hymning
 praises gods, happy converse one another.
 take care families exceed means; eye
 poverty war.

 but, said glaucon, interposing, given relish

 true, replied, forgotten; course must
 relish--salt, olives, cheese, boil roots herbs
 country people prepare; dessert shall give figs,
 peas, beans; roast myrtle-berries acorns

 expected live peace health good old age, bequeath
 similar life children them.

 yes, socrates, said, providing city pigs,
 else would feed beasts?

 would have, glaucon? replied.

 why, said, give ordinary conveniences life.
 people comfortable accustomed lie sofas,
 dine tables, sauces sweets modern
 style.

 yes, said, understand: question would
 consider is, state, luxurious state created;
 possibly harm this, state shall

 much greater.

 country enough support original inhabitants

 quite true.

 slice neighbours' land wanted us pasture
 tillage, want slice ours, if, like ourselves,
 exceed limit necessity, give
 unlimited accumulation wealth?

 that, socrates, inevitable.

 shall go war, glaucon. shall not?

 certainly, replied.

 without determining yet whether war good harm, thus much
 may affirm, discovered war derived causes
 also causes almost evils states, private
 well public.

 undoubtedly.

 state must enlarge; time enlargement

 no, said; right principle acknowledged

 remember, one man cannot practise many arts success.

 true, said.

 certainly.

 art requiring much attention shoemaking?

 quite true.

 shoemaker allowed us husbandman, weaver,

 every worker assigned one work

 other; let opportunities slip, would
 become good workman. nothing important
 work soldier well done. war art easily

 yes, said, tools would teach men use would

 yes.

 enemies destroy them.

 true, said.

 true.

 good guardian wanting either two

 hence must infer good guardian impossible.

 certainly not.

 adeimantus thought enquiry would great service us.

 certainly not.

 come then, let us pass leisure hour story-telling,

 more, bad lie.

 young person cannot judge allegorical literal;

 tales young first hear models virtuous thoughts.

 right, replied; one asks
 models found tales speaking--how shall
 answer him?

 said him, i, adeimantus, moment poets,
 founders state: founders state ought know
 general forms poets cast tales, limits
 must observed them, make tales
 business.

 true, said; forms theology mean?

 something kind, replied:--god always represented
 truly is, whatever sort poetry, epic, lyric tragic,
 representation given.

 right.

 truly good? must represented such?

 certainly.

 good thing hurtful?

 no, indeed.

 hurtful hurts not?

 certainly not.

 hurts evil?

 no.

 evil cause evil?

 impossible.

 good advantageous?

 yes.

 therefore cause well-being?

 yes.

 follows therefore good cause things,
 good only?

 assuredly.

 god, good, author things, many
 assert, cause things only, things
 occur men. goods human life, many
 evils, good attributed god alone; evils
 causes sought elsewhere, him.

 appears true, said.

 must listen homer poet guilty
 folly saying two casks

 'lie threshold zeus, full lots, one good,
 evil lots,'

 zeus gives mixture two

 'sometimes meets evil fortune, times good;'

 given cup unmingled ill,

 'him wild hunger drives o'er beauteous earth.'

 think second principle? shall ask whether god

 cannot answer you, said, without thought.

 well, said; suppose change anything, change must

 true.

 true.

 surely god things god every way perfect?

 change change worse, cannot

 true, adeimantus; then, would one, whether god man,
 desire make worse?

 impossible.

 impossible god ever willing change; being,
 supposed, fairest best conceivable, every god
 remains absolutely ever form.

 necessarily follows, said, judgment.

 then, said, dear friend, let none poets tell us

 'the gods, taking disguise strangers lands, walk
 cities sorts forms;'

 let one slander proteus thetis, neither let one, either
 tragedy kind poetry, introduce disguised
 likeness priestess asking alms

 'for life-giving daughters inachus river argos;'

 --let us lies sort. neither must mothers
 influence poets scaring children bad
 version myths--telling certain gods, say, 'go
 night likeness many strangers divers forms;'
 let take heed lest make cowards children,
 time speak blasphemy gods.

 heaven forbid, said.

 although gods unchangeable, still witchcraft
 deception may make us think appear various forms?

 perhaps, replied.

 well, imagine god willing lie, whether
 word deed, put forth phantom himself?

 cannot say, replied.

 know, said, true lie, expression may
 allowed, hated gods men?

 mean? said.

 mean one willingly deceived truest
 highest part himself, truest highest matters; there,
 all, afraid lie possession him.

 still, said, comprehend you.

 reason is, replied, attribute profound meaning
 words; saying deception, deceived
 uninformed highest realities highest part
 themselves, soul, part
 hold lie, mankind least like;--that, say,
 utterly detest.

 nothing hateful them.

 and, remarking, ignorance soul
 deceived may called true lie; lie words
 kind imitation shadowy image previous affection soul,
 pure unadulterated falsehood. right?

 perfectly right.

 true lie hated gods, also men?

 yes.

 whereas lie words certain cases useful hateful;
 dealing enemies--that would instance; again,
 call friends fit madness illusion going
 harm, useful sort medicine
 preventive; also tales mythology,
 speaking--because know truth ancient times, make
 falsehood much like truth can, turn account.

 true, said.

 reasons apply god? suppose

 would ridiculous, said.

 lying poet place idea god?

 say not.

 perhaps may tell lie afraid enemies?

 inconceivable.

 may friends senseless mad?

 mad senseless person friend god.

 motive imagined god lie?

 none whatever.

 superhuman divine absolutely incapable falsehood?

 yes.

 god perfectly simple true word deed; changes
 not; deceives not, either sign word, dream waking vision.

 thoughts, said, reflection own.

 agree then, said, second type form
 write speak divine things. gods
 magicians transform themselves, neither deceive mankind
 way.

 grant that.

 then, although admirers homer, admire lying
 dream zeus sends agamemnon; neither praise verses
 aeschylus thetis says apollo nuptials

 'was celebrating song fair progeny whose days long,
 know sickness. spoken lot
 things blessed heaven raised note triumph cheered
 soul. thought word phoebus, divine full
 prophecy, would fail. uttered strain,
 present banquet, said this--he
 slain son.'

 kind sentiments gods arouse
 anger; utters shall refused chorus; neither shall
 allow teachers make use instruction young,
 meaning, do, guardians, far men be,
 true worshippers gods like them.

 entirely agree, said, principles, promise make
 laws.




 book iii.

 then, said, principles theology--some tales

 upwards, mean honour gods parents,
 value friendship one another.

 yes; think principles right, said.

 courageous, must learn lessons
 besides these, lessons kind take away fear
 death? man courageous fear death him?

 certainly not, said.

 fearless death, choose death battle
 rather defeat slavery, believes world real
 terrible?

 impossible.

 must assume control narrators class tales
 well others, beg simply revile rather
 commend world below, intimating descriptions
 untrue, harm future warriors.

 duty, said.

 then, said, shall obliterate many obnoxious passages,
 beginning verses,

 'i would rather serf land poor portionless man
 rule dead come nought.'

 must also expunge verse, tells us pluto feared,

 'lest mansions grim squalid gods abhor seen
 mortals immortals.'

 again:--

 'o heavens! verily house hades soul ghostly form
 mind all!'

 tiresias:--

 '(to even death persephone grant mind,) alone
 wise; souls flitting shades.'

 again:--

 'the soul flying limbs gone hades, lamenting fate,
 leaving manhood youth.'

 again:--

 'and soul, shrilling cry, passed like smoke beneath earth.'

 and,--

 'as bats hollow mystic cavern, whenever dropped
 string falls rock, fly shrilling cling
 one another, shrilling cry hold together
 moved.'

 must beg homer poets angry strike
 similar passages, unpoetical,
 unattractive popular ear, greater poetical
 charm them, less meet ears boys men
 meant free, fear slavery death.

 undoubtedly.

 also shall reject terrible appalling names

 sapless shades, similar words mention causes
 shudder pass inmost soul hears them.
 say horrible stories may use kind;
 danger nerves guardians may rendered

 real danger, said.

 must them.

 true.

 another nobler strain must composed sung us.

 clearly.

 shall proceed get rid weepings wailings famous

 go rest.

 shall right getting rid them? reflect: principle
 good man consider death terrible good man
 comrade.

 yes; principle.

 therefore sorrow departed friend though

 not.

 one, maintain, sufficient
 happiness, therefore least need men.

 true, said.

 reason loss son brother, deprivation
 fortune, men least terrible.

 assuredly.

 therefore least likely lament, bear
 greatest equanimity misfortune sort may befall him.

 yes, feel misfortune far less another.

 shall right getting rid lamentations famous men,
 making women (and even women good
 anything), men baser sort, educated
 us defenders country may scorn like.

 right.

 entreat homer poets depict
 achilles, son goddess, first lying side,
 back, face; starting sailing frenzy
 along shores barren sea; taking sooty ashes
 hands pouring head, weeping wailing
 various modes homer delineated. describe priam
 kinsman gods praying beseeching,

 'rolling dirt, calling man loudly name.'

 still earnestly beg events introduce
 gods lamenting saying,

 'alas! misery! alas! bore bravest sorrow.'

 must introduce gods, rate let dare
 completely misrepresent greatest gods, make
 say--

 'o heavens! eyes verily behold dear friend mine chased
 round round city, heart sorrowful.'

 again:--

 woe fated sarpedon, dearest men me,
 subdued hands patroclus son menoetius.'

 if, sweet adeimantus, youth seriously listen unworthy
 representations gods, instead laughing ought,
 hardly deem himself, man,
 dishonoured similar actions; neither rebuke inclination
 may arise mind say like. instead
 shame self-control, always whining
 lamenting slight occasions.

 yes, said, true.

 yes, replied; surely ought be, argument
 proved us; proof must abide
 disproved better.

 ought be.

 neither ought guardians given laughter. fit
 laughter indulged excess almost always produces
 violent reaction.

 believe.

 persons worth, even mortal men, must represented
 overcome laughter, still less must representation
 gods allowed.

 still less gods, say, replied.

 shall suffer expression used gods
 homer describes

 'inextinguishable laughter arose among blessed gods, saw
 hephaestus bustling mansion.'

 views, must admit them.

 views, like father me; must admit
 certain.

 again, truth highly valued; if, saying, lie
 useless gods, useful medicine men,
 use medicines restricted physicians; private
 individuals business them.

 clearly not, said.

 one privilege lying, rulers
 state persons; they, dealings either
 enemies citizens, may allowed lie public
 good. nobody else meddle anything kind;
 although rulers privilege, private man lie
 return deemed heinous fault patient
 pupil gymnasium speak truth bodily
 illnesses physician trainer, sailor
 tell captain happening ship rest
 crew, things going fellow sailors.

 true, said.

 if, then, ruler catches anybody beside lying state,

 'any craftsmen, whether priest physician carpenter,'

 punish introducing practice equally
 subversive destructive ship state.

 certainly, said, idea state ever carried out.

 next place youth must temperate?

 certainly.

 chief elements temperance, speaking generally, obedience
 commanders self-control sensual pleasures?

 true.

 shall approve language diomede homer,

 'friend, sit still obey word,'

 verses follow,

 'the greeks marched breathing prowess, ...in silent awe

 shall.

 line,

 'o heavy wine, hast eyes dog heart stag,'

 words follow? would say these, similar
 impertinences private individuals supposed address
 rulers, whether verse prose, well ill spoken?

 ill spoken.

 may possibly afford amusement, conduce
 temperance. therefore likely harm young
 men--you would agree there?

 yes.

 then, again, make wisest men say nothing
 opinion glorious

 'when tables full bread meat, cup-bearer carries
 round wine draws bowl pours cups,'

 fit conducive temperance young man hear words?
 verse

 'the saddest fates die meet destiny hunger?'

 would say tale zeus, who, gods

 forgot moment lust, completely
 overcome sight would even go hut,
 wanted lie ground, declaring never
 state rapture before, even first met one
 another

 'without knowledge parents;'

 tale hephaestus, similar goings on, cast
 chain around ares aphrodite?

 indeed, said, strongly opinion ought hear
 sort thing.

 deeds endurance done told famous men,
 ought see hear; as, example, said verses,

 'he smote breast, thus reproached heart, endure, heart;
 far worse hast thou endured!'

 certainly, said.

 next place, must let receivers gifts lovers
 money.

 certainly not.

 neither must sing

 'gifts persuading gods, persuading reverend kings.'

 neither phoenix, tutor achilles, approved deemed
 given pupil good counsel told take
 gifts greeks assist them; without gift
 lay aside anger. neither believe acknowledge
 achilles lover money took
 agamemnon's gifts, received payment restored
 dead body hector, without payment unwilling so.

 undoubtedly, said, sentiments approved.

 loving homer do, hardly like say attributing
 feelings achilles, believing truly attributed
 him, guilty downright impiety. little believe
 narrative insolence apollo, says,

 'thou hast wronged me, far-darter, abominable deities. verily
 would even thee, power;'

 insubordination river-god, whose divinity ready

 previously dedicated river-god spercheius,

 tomb patroclus, slaughtered captives pyre;
 cannot believe guilty, allow
 citizens believe he, wise cheiron's pupil, son
 goddess peleus gentlest men third descent
 zeus, disordered wits one time slave
 two seemingly inconsistent passions, meanness, untainted
 avarice, combined overweening contempt gods men.

 quite right, replied.

 let us equally refuse believe, allow repeated, tale

 assuredly not.

 likely bad effect hear them;
 everybody begin excuse vices convinced
 similar wickednesses always perpetrated by--

 'the kindred gods, relatives zeus, whose ancestral altar,
 altar zeus, aloft air peak ida,'



 'the blood deities yet flowing veins.'

 therefore let us put end tales, lest engender laxity

 clearly so.

 because, mistaken, shall say men poets

 sure shall, replied.

 grant truth inference.

 things said men question
 cannot determine discovered justice is,
 naturally advantageous possessor, whether seem
 not.

 true, said.

 enough subjects poetry: let us speak style;
 considered, matter manner
 completely treated.

 understand mean, said adeimantus.

 must make understand; perhaps may intelligible
 put matter way. aware, suppose,
 mythology poetry narration events, either past, present,
 come?

 certainly, replied.

 narration may either simple narration, imitation, union
 two?

 again, said, quite understand.

 fear must ridiculous teacher much
 difficulty making apprehended. like bad speaker, therefore,
 take whole subject, break piece
 illustration meaning. know first lines iliad,
 poet says chryses prayed agamemnon release
 daughter, agamemnon flew passion him; whereupon
 chryses, failing object, invoked anger god
 achaeans. far lines,

 'and prayed greeks, especially two sons atreus,
 chiefs people,'

 poet speaking person; never leads us suppose
 one else. follows takes person
 chryses, make us believe
 speaker homer, aged priest himself. double
 form cast entire narrative events occurred
 troy ithaca throughout odyssey.

 yes.

 narrative remains speeches poet recites
 time time intermediate passages?

 quite true.

 poet speaks person another, may say
 assimilates style person who, informs you,
 going speak?

 certainly.

 assimilation another, either use voice
 gesture, imitation person whose character assumes?

 course.

 case narrative poet may said proceed
 way imitation?

 true.

 or, poet everywhere appears never conceals himself,
 imitation dropped, poetry becomes simple narration.
 however, order may make meaning quite clear,
 may say, 'i understand,' show change might
 effected. homer said, 'the priest came, daughter's
 ransom hands, supplicating achaeans,
 kings;' if, instead speaking person chryses,
 continued person, words would been,
 imitation, simple narration. passage would run follows
 (i poet, therefore drop metre), 'the priest came
 prayed gods behalf greeks might capture troy
 return safely home, begged would give back
 daughter, take ransom brought, respect god.
 thus spoke, greeks revered priest assented.
 agamemnon wroth, bade depart come again, lest
 staff chaplets god avail him--the daughter
 chryses released, said--she grow old
 argos. told go away provoke him,
 intended get home unscathed. old man went away fear
 silence, and, left camp, called upon apollo
 many names, reminding everything done pleasing
 him, whether building temples, offering sacrifice,
 praying good deeds might returned him,
 achaeans might expiate tears arrows god,'--and on.
 way whole becomes simple narrative.

 understand, said.

 may suppose opposite case--that intermediate passages
 omitted, dialogue left.

 also, said, understand; mean, example, tragedy.

 conceived meaning perfectly; mistake not,
 failed apprehend made clear you, poetry
 mythology are, cases, wholly imitative--instances
 supplied tragedy comedy; likewise opposite style,
 poet speaker--of dithyramb affords
 best example; combination found epic,
 several styles poetry. take me?

 yes, said; see meant.

 ask remember also began saying, done
 subject might proceed style.

 yes, remember.

 saying this, intended imply must come
 understanding mimetic art,--whether poets, narrating
 stories, allowed us imitate, so, whether
 whole part, latter, parts;
 imitation prohibited?

 mean, suspect, ask whether tragedy comedy shall admitted
 state?

 yes, said; may question: really
 know yet, whither argument may blow, thither go.

 go will, said.

 then, adeimantus, let ask whether guardians ought
 imitators; rather, question decided rule
 already laid one man one thing well, many;
 attempt many, altogether fail gaining much
 reputation any?

 certainly.

 equally true imitation; one man imitate many
 things well would imitate single one?

 cannot.

 person hardly able play serious part life,
 time imitator imitate many parts
 well; even two species imitation nearly allied,
 persons cannot succeed both, as, example, writers tragedy
 comedy--did call imitations?

 yes, did; right thinking persons cannot
 succeed both.

 rhapsodists actors once?

 true.

 neither comic tragic actors same; yet things
 imitations.

 so.

 human nature, adeimantus, appears coined yet
 smaller pieces, incapable imitating many things well,
 performing well actions imitations copies.

 quite true, replied.

 adhere original notion bear mind
 guardians, setting aside every business, dedicate
 wholly maintenance freedom state, making
 craft, engaging work bear
 end, ought practise imitate anything else;
 imitate all, imitate youth upward
 characters suitable profession--the courageous,
 temperate, holy, free, like; depict
 skilful imitating kind illiberality baseness, lest
 imitation come imitate. never
 observe imitations, beginning early youth continuing far
 life, length grow habits become second nature, affecting
 body, voice, mind?

 yes, certainly, said.

 then, said, allow profess care
 say ought good men, imitate woman, whether
 young old, quarrelling husband, striving vaunting
 gods conceit happiness,
 affliction, sorrow, weeping; certainly one
 sickness, love, labour.

 right, said.

 neither must represent slaves, male female, performing
 offices slaves?

 must not.

 surely bad men, whether cowards others,
 reverse prescribing, scold mock
 revile one another drink drink, manner
 sin neighbours word deed,
 manner is. neither trained imitate action
 speech men women mad bad; madness, like vice,
 known practised imitated.

 true, replied.

 neither may imitate smiths artificers, oarsmen,
 boatswains, like?

 they, said, allowed apply minds
 callings these?

 may imitate neighing horses, bellowing bulls,
 murmur rivers roll ocean, thunder, sort
 thing?

 nay, said, madness forbidden, neither may copy
 behaviour madmen.

 mean, said, understand aright, one sort
 narrative style may employed truly good man
 anything say, another sort used man
 opposite character education.

 two sorts? asked.

 suppose, answered, good man course
 narration comes saying action another good man,--i
 imagine like personate him, ashamed
 sort imitation: ready play part
 good man acting firmly wisely; less degree
 overtaken illness love drink, met
 disaster. comes character unworthy him,
 make study that; disdain person,
 assume likeness, all, moment performing
 good action; times ashamed play part
 never practised, like fashion frame
 baser models; feels employment art, unless
 jest, beneath him, mind revolts it.

 expect, replied.

 adopt mode narration illustrated
 homer, say, style imitative
 narrative; little former, great deal
 latter. agree?

 certainly, said; model speaker must
 necessarily take.

 another sort character narrate anything, and,
 worse is, unscrupulous be; nothing
 bad him: ready imitate anything, joke,
 right good earnest, large company.
 saying, attempt represent roll thunder, noise
 wind hail, creaking wheels, pulleys, various
 sounds flutes, pipes, trumpets, sorts instruments:
 bark like dog, bleat like sheep, crow like cock; entire art
 consist imitation voice gesture,
 little narration.

 that, said, mode speaking.

 these, then, two kinds style?

 yes.

 would agree saying one simple
 slight changes; harmony rhythm also chosen
 simplicity, result speaker, speaks
 correctly, always pretty much style, keep
 within limits single harmony (for changes great),
 like manner make use nearly rhythm?

 quite true, said.

 whereas requires sorts harmonies sorts
 rhythms, music style correspond, style
 sorts changes.

 also perfectly true, replied.

 two styles, mixture two, comprehend
 poetry, every form expression words? one say anything
 except one together.

 include all, said.

 shall receive state three styles, one
 two unmixed styles? would include mixed?

 prefer admit pure imitator virtue.

 yes, said, adeimantus, mixed style also charming:
 indeed pantomimic, opposite one chosen you,
 popular style children attendants,
 world general.

 deny it.

 suppose would argue style unsuitable
 state, human nature twofold manifold, one man
 plays one part only?

 yes; quite unsuitable.

 reason state, state only,
 shall find shoemaker shoemaker pilot also,
 husbandman husbandman dicast also, soldier
 soldier trader also, throughout?

 true, said.

 therefore one pantomimic gentlemen,
 clever imitate anything, comes us, makes proposal
 exhibit poetry, fall worship

 allow them. anointed myrrh, set
 garland wool upon head, shall send away another city.

 certainly will, said, power.

 now, friend, said, part music literary education

 matter manner discussed.

 think too, said.

 next order follow melody song.

 obvious.

 every one see already ought say them,
 consistent ourselves.

 fear, said glaucon, laughing, word 'every one' hardly
 includes me, cannot moment say be; though
 may guess.

 rate tell song ode three parts--the words,
 melody, rhythm; degree knowledge may presuppose?

 yes, said; much may.

 words, surely difference words

 laws, already determined us?

 yes.

 melody rhythm depend upon words?

 certainly.

 saying, spoke subject-matter, need
 lamentation strains sorrow?

 true.

 harmonies expressive sorrow? musical,
 tell me.

 harmonies mean mixed tenor lydian,
 full-toned bass lydian, like.

 then, said, must banished; even women character
 maintain use, much less men.

 certainly.

 next place, drunkenness softness indolence utterly
 unbecoming character guardians.

 utterly unbecoming.

 soft drinking harmonies?

 ionian, replied, lydian; termed 'relaxed.'

 well, military use?

 quite reverse, replied; dorian phrygian
 ones left.

 answered: harmonies know nothing, want one
 warlike, sound note accent brave man utters
 hour danger stern resolve, cause failing,
 going wounds death overtaken evil,
 every crisis meets blows fortune firm step
 determination endure; another used times peace
 freedom action, pressure necessity,
 seeking persuade god prayer, man instruction admonition,
 hand, expressing willingness yield
 persuasion entreaty admonition, represents
 prudent conduct attained end, carried away
 success, acting moderately wisely circumstances,
 acquiescing event. two harmonies ask leave;
 strain necessity strain freedom, strain
 unfortunate strain fortunate, strain courage,
 strain temperance; these, say, leave.

 these, replied, dorian phrygian harmonies
 speaking.

 then, said, used songs
 melodies, shall want multiplicity notes panharmonic
 scale?

 suppose not.

 shall maintain artificers lyres three
 corners complex scales, makers many-stringed
 curiously-harmonised instruments?

 certainly not.

 say flute-makers flute-players? would admit
 state reflect composite use
 harmony flute worse stringed instruments put
 together; even panharmonic music imitation flute?

 clearly not.

 remain lyre harp use city,
 shepherds may pipe country.

 surely conclusion drawn argument.

 preferring apollo instruments marsyas
 instruments strange, said.

 all, replied.

 so, dog egypt, unconsciously purging
 state, long ago termed luxurious.

 done wisely, replied.

 let us finish purgation, said. next order
 harmonies, rhythms naturally follow, subject
 rules, ought seek complex systems metre,
 metres every kind, rather discover rhythms
 expressions courageous harmonious life; found
 them, shall adapt foot melody words like
 spirit, words foot melody. say rhythms
 duty--you must teach them, already
 taught harmonies.

 but, indeed, replied, cannot tell you. know
 three principles rhythm metrical systems
 framed, sounds four notes (i.e. four notes
 tetrachord.) harmonies composed;
 observation made. sort lives
 severally imitations unable say.

 then, said, must take damon counsels; tell us
 rhythms expressive meanness, insolence, fury,
 unworthiness, reserved expression opposite
 feelings. think indistinct recollection
 mentioning complex cretic rhythm; also dactylic heroic,
 arranged manner quite understand, making
 rhythms equal rise fall foot, long short
 alternating; and, unless mistaken, spoke iambic well
 trochaic rhythm, assigned short long quantities.
 also cases appeared praise censure movement
 foot quite much rhythm; perhaps combination two;
 certain meant. matters, however,
 saying, better referred damon himself, analysis
 subject would difficult, know? (socrates expresses
 carelessly accordance assumed ignorance details
 subject. first part sentence appears speaking
 paeonic rhythms ratio 3/2; second part,
 dactylic anapaestic rhythms, ratio 1/1;
 last clause, iambic trochaic rhythms, ratio
 1/2 2/1.)

 rather so, say.

 difficulty seeing grace absence grace
 effect good bad rhythm.

 none all.

 also good bad rhythm naturally assimilate good bad
 style; harmony discord like manner follow style;
 principle rhythm harmony regulated words,
 words them.

 so, said, follow words.

 words character style depend
 temper soul?

 yes.

 everything else style?

 yes.

 beauty style harmony grace good rhythm depend
 simplicity,--i mean true simplicity rightly nobly ordered
 mind character, simplicity euphemism
 folly?

 true, replied.

 youth work life, must make
 graces harmonies perpetual aim?

 must.

 surely art painter every creative
 constructive art full them,--weaving, embroidery, architecture,
 every kind manufacture; also nature, animal vegetable,--in
 grace absence grace. ugliness
 discord inharmonious motion nearly allied ill words ill
 nature, grace harmony twin sisters goodness virtue

 quite true, said.

 shall superintendence go further, poets
 required us express image good works,

 control extended artists, also
 prohibited exhibiting opposite forms vice intemperance
 meanness indecency sculpture building

 nobler training that, replied.

 therefore, said, glaucon, musical training potent
 instrument other, rhythm harmony find way
 inward places soul, mightily fasten,

 yes, said, quite agree thinking youth

 assuredly.

 fairest indeed.

 fairest also loveliest?

 may assumed.

 book iv.

 adeimantus interposed question: would answer, socrates,
 said he, person say making people
 miserable, cause unhappiness;
 city fact belongs them, none better it;
 whereas men acquire lands, build large handsome houses,
 everything handsome them, offering sacrifices gods
 account, practising hospitality; moreover,
 saying now, gold silver, usual among
 favourites fortune; poor citizens better
 mercenaries quartered city always mounting guard?

 yes, said; may add fed, paid
 addition food, like men; therefore cannot,
 would, take journey pleasure; money spend
 mistress luxurious fancy, which, world goes,
 thought happiness; many accusations nature
 might added.

 but, said he, let us suppose included charge.

 mean ask, said, answer?

 yes.

 proceed along old path, belief, said, shall
 find answer. answer that, even are,
 guardians may likely happiest men; aim
 founding state disproportionate happiness one
 class, greatest happiness whole; thought
 state ordered view good whole
 likely find justice, ill-ordered state injustice:
 and, found them, might decide two
 happier. present, take it, fashioning happy state,
 piecemeal, view making happy citizens,
 whole; by-and-by proceed view opposite kind state.
 suppose painting statue, one came us
 said, put beautiful colours

 surely us beautify eyes degree
 longer eyes; consider rather whether, giving
 features due proportion, make whole beautiful. say
 you, compel us assign guardians sort happiness
 make anything guardians; clothe
 husbandmen royal apparel, set crowns gold heads,
 bid till ground much like, more. potters
 also might allowed repose couches, feast fireside,
 passing round winecup, wheel conveniently hand,
 working pottery much like; way might
 make every class happy--and then, imagine, whole state would
 happy. put idea heads; for, listen
 you, husbandman longer husbandman, potter
 cease potter, one character distinct

 corruption society, pretension not,
 confined cobblers; guardians laws
 government seeming real guardians, see
 turn state upside down; hand alone
 power giving order happiness state. mean guardians
 true saviours destroyers state, whereas
 opponent thinking peasants festival, enjoying life
 revelry, citizens duty state. but,
 so, mean different things, speaking something
 state. therefore must consider whether appointing
 guardians would look greatest happiness individually,
 whether principle happiness rather reside state
 whole. latter truth, guardians
 auxiliaries, others equally them, must compelled
 induced work best way. thus whole state
 grow noble order, several classes receive
 proportion happiness nature assigns them.

 think quite right.

 wonder whether agree another remark occurs me.

 may be?

 seem two causes deterioration arts.

 they?

 wealth, said, poverty.

 act?

 process follows: potter becomes rich, he, think
 you, longer take pains art?

 certainly not.

 grow indolent careless?

 true.

 result becomes worse potter?

 yes; greatly deteriorates.

 but, hand, money, cannot provide
 tools instruments, work equally well himself,
 teach sons apprentices work equally well.

 certainly not.

 then, influence either poverty wealth, workmen
 work equally liable degenerate?

 evident.

 here, then, discovery new evils, said,
 guardians watch, creep city
 unobserved.

 evils?

 wealth, said, poverty; one parent luxury
 indolence, meanness viciousness,
 discontent.

 true, replied; still like know,
 socrates, city able go war, especially
 enemy rich powerful, deprived sinews war.

 would certainly difficulty, replied, going war
 one enemy; difficulty two them.

 so? asked.

 first place, said, fight, side
 trained warriors fighting army rich men.

 true, said.

 suppose, adeimantus, single boxer
 perfect art would easily match two stout well-to-do
 gentlemen boxers?

 hardly, came upon once.

 what, now, said, able run away turn strike
 one first came up? supposing several
 times heat scorching sun, might not, expert,
 overturn one stout personage?

 certainly, said, would nothing wonderful that.

 yet rich men probably greater superiority science

 likely enough.

 may assume athletes able fight two

 agree you, think right.

 suppose that, engaging, citizens send embassy one

 neither permitted have, may; therefore
 come help us war, take spoils city: who,
 hearing words, would choose fight lean wiry dogs,
 rather than, dogs side, fat tender sheep?

 likely; yet might danger poor state

 so?

 ought speak states plural number; one

 city, however small, fact divided two, one city
 poor, rich; war one another;
 either many smaller divisions, would altogether
 beside mark treated single state.
 deal many, give wealth power persons

 equal hardly find, either among hellenes
 barbarians, though many appear great many times
 greater.

 true, said.

 what, said, best limit rulers fix
 considering size state amount territory
 include, beyond go?

 limit would propose?

 would allow state increase far consistent unity;
 that, think, proper limit.

 good, said.

 then, said, another order conveyed
 guardians: let city accounted neither large small,
 one self-sufficing.

 surely, said he, severe order impose
 upon them.

 other, said i, speaking lighter
 still,--i mean duty degrading offspring guardians
 inferior, elevating rank guardians offspring
 lower classes, naturally superior. intention was, that,
 case citizens generally, individual put
 use nature intended him, one one work, every man
 would business, one many; whole
 city would one many.

 yes, said; difficult.

 regulations prescribing, good adeimantus, not,
 might supposed, number great principles, trifles all,
 care taken, saying is, one great thing,--a thing,
 however, would rather call, great, sufficient
 purpose.

 may be? asked.

 education, said, nurture: citizens well educated,
 grow sensible men, easily see way
 these, well matters omit; such, example,
 marriage, possession women procreation children,
 follow general principle friends things
 common, proverb says.

 best way settling them.

 also, said, state, started well, moves accumulating
 force like wheel. good nurture education implant good
 constitutions, good constitutions taking root good
 education improve more, improvement affects breed
 man animals.

 possibly, said.

 sum up: point which, all, attention
 rulers directed,--that music gymnastic preserved
 original form, innovation made. must utmost
 maintain intact. one says mankind regard

 'the newest song singers have,'

 afraid may praising, new songs, new
 kind song; ought praised, conceived
 meaning poet; musical innovation full danger
 whole state, ought prohibited. damon tells me,
 quite believe him;--he says modes music change,
 fundamental laws state always change them.

 yes, said adeimantus; may add suffrage damon's
 own.

 then, said, guardians must lay foundations fortress
 music?

 yes, said; lawlessness speak easily steals in.

 yes, replied, form amusement; first sight appears
 harmless.

 why, yes, said, harm; little
 little spirit licence, finding home, imperceptibly penetrates
 manners customs; whence, issuing greater force, invades
 contracts man man, contracts goes laws
 constitutions, utter recklessness, ending last, socrates,
 overthrow rights, private well public.

 true? said.

 then, saying, youth trained first
 stricter system, amusements become lawless, youths
 become lawless, never grow well-conducted
 virtuous citizens.

 true, said.

 made good beginning play, help
 music gained habit good order, habit order,

 true, said.

 thus educated, invent lesser rules
 predecessors altogether neglected.

 mean?

 mean things these:--when young silent
 elders; show respect standing
 making sit; honour due parents; garments shoes
 worn; mode dressing hair; deportment manners
 general. would agree me?

 yes.

 is, think, small wisdom legislating
 matters,--i doubt ever done; precise written
 enactments likely lasting.

 impossible.

 would seem, adeimantus, direction education starts
 man, determine future life. like always attract
 like?

 sure.

 one rare grand result reached may good,
 may reverse good?

 denied.

 reason, said, shall attempt legislate

 naturally enough, replied.

 well, business agora, ordinary dealings
 man man, agreements artisans;
 insult injury, commencement actions, appointment
 juries, would say? may also arise questions
 impositions exactions market harbour dues may
 required, general regulations markets, police,
 harbours, like. but, oh heavens! shall condescend
 legislate particulars?

 think, said, need impose laws
 good men; regulations necessary find soon enough
 themselves.

 yes, said, friend, god preserve laws
 given them.

 without divine help, said adeimantus, go ever
 making mending laws lives hope attaining
 perfection.

 would compare them, said, invalids who,
 self-restraint, leave habits intemperance?

 exactly.

 yes, said; delightful life lead! always

 assuredly not.

 would praise behaviour states act like men

 citizens forbidden pain death alter

 good statesman--do states resemble persons
 describing?

 yes, said; states bad men; far
 praising them.

 yes, said, do; them,
 applause multitude deluded belief
 really statesmen, much admired.

 mean? said; feeling them.
 man cannot measure, great many others cannot measure declare
 four cubits high, help believing say?

 nay, said, certainly case.

 well, then, angry them; good
 play, trying hand paltry reforms describing;
 always fancying legislation make end frauds

 yes, said; doing.

 conceive, said, true legislator trouble

 where, amid this, justice? son ariston, tell where.
 city made habitable, light candle search,
 get brother polemarchus rest friends help,
 let us see discover justice injustice,
 differ one another, man
 would happy portion, whether seen unseen
 gods men.

 nonsense, said glaucon: promise search yourself, saying
 help justice need would impiety?

 deny said so, remind me, good
 word; must join.

 will, replied.

 well, then, hope make discovery way: mean begin
 assumption state, rightly ordered, perfect.

 certain.

 perfect, therefore wise valiant temperate just.

 likewise clear.

 whichever qualities find state, one
 found residue?

 good.

 four things, searching one them,
 wherever might be, one sought might known us
 first, would trouble; might know
 three first, fourth would clearly one left.

 true, said.

 similar method pursued virtues,
 also four number?

 clearly.

 first among virtues found state, wisdom comes view,
 detect certain peculiarity.

 that?

 state describing said wise good
 counsel?

 true.

 good counsel clearly kind knowledge, ignorance,
 knowledge, men counsel well?

 clearly.

 kinds knowledge state many diverse?

 course.

 knowledge carpenter; sort
 knowledge gives city title wise good counsel?

 certainly not; would give city reputation skill
 carpentering.

 city called wise possessing knowledge
 counsels best wooden implements?

 certainly not.

 reason knowledge advises brazen pots, said,
 possessing similar knowledge?

 reason them, said.

 yet reason knowledge cultivates earth; would
 give city name agricultural?

 yes.

 well, said, knowledge recently-founded state
 among citizens advises, particular thing
 state, whole, considers state best
 deal states?

 certainly is.

 knowledge, among found? asked.

 knowledge guardians, replied, found among
 describing perfect guardians.

 name city derives possession
 sort knowledge?

 name good counsel truly wise.

 city true guardians
 smiths?

 smiths, replied, far numerous.

 guardians smallest classes receive
 name profession kind knowledge?

 much smallest.

 reason smallest part class, knowledge
 resides presiding ruling part itself, whole
 state, thus constituted according nature, wise;
 this, knowledge worthy called wisdom,
 ordained nature classes least.

 true.

 thus, then, said, nature place state one four
 virtues somehow discovered.

 and, humble opinion, satisfactorily discovered, replied.

 again, said, difficulty seeing nature courage,
 part quality resides gives name courageous
 state.

 mean?

 why, said, every one calls state courageous cowardly,
 thinking part fights goes war state's
 behalf.

 one, replied, would ever think other.

 rest citizens may courageous may cowardly,
 courage cowardice not, conceive, effect making
 city either one other.

 certainly not.

 city courageous virtue portion
 preserves circumstances opinion nature
 things feared feared legislator
 educated them; term courage.

 like hear saying more, think
 perfectly understand you.

 mean courage kind salvation.

 salvation what?

 opinion respecting things feared,
 nature, law implants education; mean
 words 'under circumstances' intimate pleasure pain,
 influence desire fear, man preserves,
 lose opinion. shall give illustration?

 please.

 know, said, dyers, want dye wool making

 prepare dress much care pains, order white
 ground may take purple hue full perfection. dyeing
 proceeds; whatever dyed manner becomes fast colour,
 washing either lyes without take away bloom.
 but, ground duly prepared, noticed
 poor look either purple colour.

 yes, said; know washed-out ridiculous
 appearance.

 now, said, understand object selecting
 soldiers, educating music gymnastic;
 contriving influences would prepare take dye
 laws perfection, colour opinion dangers
 every opinion indelibly fixed nurture

 sort universal saving power true opinion conformity

 unless disagree.

 agree, replied; suppose mean exclude mere
 uninstructed courage, wild beast slave--this,
 opinion, courage law ordains, ought
 another name.

 certainly.

 may infer courage describe?

 why, yes, said i, may, add words 'of citizen,'
 far wrong;--hereafter, like, carry
 examination further, present seeking courage
 justice; purpose enquiry said enough.

 right, replied.

 two virtues remain discovered state--first, temperance,
 justice end search.

 true.

 now, find justice without troubling temperance?

 know accomplished, said, desire
 justice brought light temperance lost sight of;
 therefore wish would favour considering
 temperance first.

 certainly, replied, justified refusing
 request.

 consider, said.

 yes, replied; will; far present see, virtue
 temperance nature harmony symphony
 preceding.

 so? asked.

 temperance, replied, ordering controlling certain
 pleasures desires; curiously enough implied saying
 'a man master;' traces notion may
 found language.

 doubt, said.

 something ridiculous expression 'master himself;'
 master also servant servant master;
 modes speaking person denoted.

 certainly.

 meaning is, believe, human soul better
 also worse principle; better worse control,
 man said master himself; term
 praise: when, owing evil education association, better
 principle, also smaller, overwhelmed greater mass
 worse--in case blamed called slave self
 unprincipled.

 yes, reason that.

 now, said, look newly-created state,
 find one two conditions realized; state,
 acknowledge, may justly called master itself, words
 'temperance' 'self-mastery' truly express rule better
 part worse.

 yes, said, see say true.

 let note manifold complex pleasures desires
 pains generally found children women servants,
 freemen called lowest numerous class.

 certainly, said.

 whereas simple moderate desires follow reason,
 guidance mind true opinion, found
 few, best born best educated.

 true.

 two, may perceive, place state;
 meaner desires many held virtuous desires
 wisdom few.

 perceive, said.

 city may described master
 pleasures desires, master itself, may claim
 designation?

 certainly, replied.

 may also called temperate, reasons?

 yes.

 state rulers subjects agreed
 question rule, state?

 undoubtedly.

 citizens thus agreed among themselves, class
 temperance found--in rulers subjects?

 both, imagine, replied.

 observe far wrong guess temperance
 sort harmony?

 so?

 why, temperance unlike courage wisdom,
 resides part only, one making state wise
 valiant; temperance, extends whole, runs
 notes scale, produces harmony weaker
 stronger middle class, whether suppose stronger
 weaker wisdom power numbers wealth, anything else.
 truly may deem temperance agreement
 naturally superior inferior, right rule either,
 states individuals.

 entirely agree you.

 so, said, may consider three four virtues
 discovered state. last qualities make
 state virtuous must justice, knew was.

 inference obvious.

 time arrived, glaucon, when, like huntsmen,
 surround cover, look sharp justice steal away,
 pass sight escape us; beyond doubt somewhere
 country: watch therefore strive catch sight her,
 see first, let know.

 would could! regard rather follower
 eyes enough see show him--that much
 good for.

 offer prayer follow.

 will, must show way.

 path, said, wood dark perplexing; still
 must push on.

 let us push on.

 saw something: halloo! said, begin perceive track,
 believe quarry escape.

 good news, said.

 truly, said, stupid fellows.

 so?

 why, good sir, beginning enquiry, ages ago,
 justice tumbling feet, never saw her; nothing could
 ridiculous. like people go looking
 hands--that way us--we looked
 seeking, far distance; therefore,
 suppose, missed her.

 mean?

 mean say reality long time past talking
 justice, failed recognise her.

 grow impatient length exordium.

 well then, tell me, said, whether right not: remember
 original principle always laying foundation
 state, one man practise one thing only, thing
 nature best adapted;--now justice principle
 part it.

 yes, often said one man one thing only.

 further, affirmed justice one's business,
 busybody; said again, many others said
 us.

 yes, said so.

 one's business certain way may assumed
 justice. tell whence derive inference?

 cannot, like told.

 think virtue remains
 state virtues temperance courage wisdom
 abstracted; and, ultimate cause condition
 existence them, remaining also
 preservative; saying three discovered
 us, justice would fourth remaining one.

 follows necessity.

 asked determine four qualities
 presence contributes excellence state, whether
 agreement rulers subjects, preservation soldiers
 opinion law ordains true nature dangers,
 wisdom watchfulness rulers, whether
 mentioning, found children women, slave freeman,
 artisan, ruler, subject,--the quality, mean, every one
 work, busybody, would claim palm--the question
 easily answered.

 certainly, replied, would difficulty saying which.

 power individual state work
 appears compete political virtues, wisdom, temperance,
 courage.

 yes, said.

 virtue enters competition justice?

 exactly.

 let us look question another point view:
 rulers state would entrust office
 determining suits law?

 certainly.

 suits decided ground man may neither
 take another's, deprived own?

 yes; principle.

 principle?

 yes.

 view also justice admitted
 man's own, belongs him?

 true.

 think, now, say whether agree not. suppose
 carpenter business cobbler, cobbler
 carpenter; suppose exchange implements
 duties, person work both, whatever
 change; think great harm would result state?

 much.

 cobbler man nature designed
 trader, heart lifted wealth strength number
 followers, like advantage, attempts force way
 class warriors, warrior legislators
 guardians, unfitted, either take implements
 duties other; one man trader, legislator,
 warrior one, think agree saying
 interchange meddling one another ruin
 state.

 true.

 seeing then, said, three distinct classes, meddling
 one another, change one another, greatest
 harm state, may justly termed evil-doing?

 precisely.

 greatest degree evil-doing one's city would termed
 injustice?

 certainly.

 injustice; hand trader,
 auxiliary, guardian business, justice,
 make city just.

 agree you.

 not, said, over-positive yet; if, trial,
 conception justice verified individual well
 state, longer room doubt;
 verified, must fresh enquiry. first let us complete old
 investigation, began, remember, impression
 that, could previously examine justice larger scale,
 would less difficulty discerning individual.
 larger example appeared state, accordingly constructed
 good one could, knowing well good state justice
 would found. let discovery made applied
 individual--if agree, shall satisfied; or,
 difference individual, come back state
 another trial theory. friction two rubbed
 together may possibly strike light justice shine forth,
 vision revealed fix souls.

 regular course; let us say.

 proceeded ask: two things, greater less, called
 name, like unlike far called
 same?

 like, replied.

 man then, regard idea justice only, like
 state?

 will.

 state thought us three classes
 state severally business; also thought temperate
 valiant wise reason certain affections qualities
 classes?

 true, said.

 individual; may assume three
 principles soul found state; may
 rightly described terms, affected
 manner?

 certainly, said.

 then, friend, alighted upon easy
 question--whether soul three principles not?

 easy question! nay, rather, socrates, proverb holds hard
 good.

 true, said; think method
 employing adequate accurate solution question;
 true method another longer one. still may arrive
 solution level previous enquiry.

 may satisfied that? said;--under circumstances,
 quite content.

 too, replied, shall extremely well satisfied.

 faint pursuing speculation, said.

 must acknowledge, said, us
 principles habits state;
 individual pass state?--how else come there? take
 quality passion spirit;--it would ridiculous imagine
 quality, found states, derived
 individuals supposed possess it, e.g. thracians,
 scythians, general northern nations; may said
 love knowledge, special characteristic
 part world, love money, may, equal truth,
 attributed phoenicians egyptians.

 exactly so, said.

 difficulty understanding this.

 none whatever.

 question quite easy proceed ask whether
 principles three one; whether, say, learn
 one part nature, angry another, third
 part desire satisfaction natural appetites; whether
 whole soul comes play sort action--to determine
 difficulty.

 yes, said; lies difficulty.

 let us try determine whether
 different.

 we? asked.

 replied follows: thing clearly cannot act acted upon
 part relation thing time,
 contrary ways; therefore whenever contradiction occurs
 things apparently same, know really same,
 different.

 good.

 example, said, thing rest motion
 time part?

 impossible.

 still, said, let us precise statement terms, lest
 hereafter fall way. imagine case man
 standing also moving hands head, suppose person
 say one person motion rest
 moment--to mode speech object, rather say
 one part motion another rest.

 true.

 suppose objector refine still further, draw nice
 distinction parts tops, whole tops, spin
 round pegs fixed spot, rest motion
 time (and may say anything revolves
 spot), objection would admitted us,
 cases things rest motion parts
 themselves; rather say axis
 circumference, axis stands still, deviation
 perpendicular; circumference goes round. if,
 revolving, axis inclines either right left, forwards
 backwards, point view rest.

 correct mode describing them, replied.

 none objections confuse us, incline us believe
 thing time, part relation
 thing, act acted upon contrary ways.

 certainly not, according way thinking.

 yet, said, may compelled examine
 objections, prove length untrue, let us assume
 absurdity, go forward understanding hereafter,
 assumption turn untrue, consequences follow
 shall withdrawn.

 yes, said, best way.

 well, said, would allow assent dissent, desire
 aversion, attraction repulsion, opposites, whether
 regarded active passive (for makes difference
 fact opposition)?

 yes, said, opposites.

 well, said, hunger thirst, desires general,
 willing wishing,--all would refer classes
 already mentioned. would say--would not?--that soul
 desires seeking object desire;
 drawing thing wishes possess: again,
 person wants anything given him, mind, longing
 realization desire, intimates wish nod
 assent, asked question?

 true.

 would say unwillingness dislike absence
 desire; referred opposite class repulsion
 rejection?

 certainly.

 admitting true desire generally, let us suppose
 particular class desires, select hunger
 thirst, termed, obvious them?

 let us take class, said.

 object one food, drink?

 yes.

 comes point: thirst desire soul
 drink, drink only; drink qualified anything else;
 example, warm cold, much little, or, word, drink
 particular sort: thirst accompanied heat,
 desire cold drink; or, accompanied cold, warm drink;
 or, thirst excessive, drink desired
 excessive; or, great, quantity drink also small:
 thirst pure simple desire drink pure simple,
 natural satisfaction thirst, food hunger?

 yes, said; simple desire is, say, every case
 simple object, qualified desire qualified object.

 confusion may arise; wish guard
 opponent starting saying man desires drink only, good
 drink, food only, good food; good universal object
 desire, thirst desire, necessarily thirst good
 drink; true every desire.

 yes, replied, opponent might something say.

 nevertheless still maintain, relatives
 quality attached either term relation; others simple
 correlatives simple.

 know mean.

 well, know course greater relative less?

 certainly.

 much greater much less?

 yes.

 sometime greater sometime less, greater
 less be?

 certainly, said.

 less, correlative terms,
 double half, again, heavier lighter, swifter
 slower; hot cold, relatives;--is
 true them?

 yes.

 principle hold sciences? object
 science knowledge (assuming true definition),
 object particular science particular kind knowledge;
 mean, example, science house-building kind
 knowledge defined distinguished kinds
 therefore termed architecture.

 certainly.

 particular quality has?

 yes.

 particular quality object
 particular kind; true arts sciences?

 yes.

 now, then, made clear, understand original
 meaning said relatives. meaning was, one term
 relation taken alone, taken alone; one term
 qualified, also qualified. mean say
 relatives may disparate, science health
 healthy, disease necessarily diseased, sciences
 good evil therefore good evil; that, term
 science longer used absolutely, qualified object
 case nature health disease, becomes defined,
 hence called merely science, science medicine.

 quite understand, think do.

 would say thirst one essentially relative
 terms, clearly relation--

 yes, thirst relative drink.

 certain kind thirst relative certain kind drink;
 thirst taken alone neither much little, good bad,
 particular kind drink, drink only?

 certainly.

 soul thirsty one, far thirsty, desires
 drink; yearns tries obtain it?

 plain.

 suppose something pulls thirsty soul away drink,
 must different thirsty principle draws like
 beast drink; for, saying, thing cannot
 time part act contrary ways
 same.

 impossible.

 say hands archer push pull
 bow time, say one hand pushes
 pulls.

 exactly so, replied.

 might man thirsty, yet unwilling drink?

 yes, said, constantly happens.

 case one say? would say
 something soul bidding man drink, something else
 forbidding him, stronger principle
 bids him?

 say so.

 forbidding principle derived reason, bids
 attracts proceeds passion disease?

 clearly.

 may fairly assume two, differ
 one another; one man reasons, may call rational
 principle soul, other, loves hungers
 thirsts feels flutterings desire, may termed
 irrational appetitive, ally sundry pleasures
 satisfactions?

 yes, said, may fairly assume different.

 let us finally determine two principles existing
 soul. passion, spirit? third, akin one
 preceding?

 inclined say--akin desire.

 well, said, story remember heard,
 put faith. story is, leontius, son aglaion,
 coming one day piraeus, north wall outside,
 observed dead bodies lying ground place execution.
 felt desire see them, also dread abhorrence them;
 time struggled covered eyes, length desire
 got better him; forcing open, ran dead
 bodies, saying, look, ye wretches, take fill fair sight.

 heard story myself, said.

 moral tale is, anger times goes war desire,
 though two distinct things.

 yes; meaning, said.

 many cases observe man's
 desires violently prevail reason, reviles himself,
 angry violence within him, struggle,
 like struggle factions state, spirit side
 reason;--but passionate spirited element take part
 desires reason decides opposed,
 sort thing believe never observed occurring
 yourself, nor, imagine, one else?

 certainly not.

 suppose man thinks done wrong another, nobler
 less able feel indignant suffering,
 hunger, cold, pain injured person may inflict
 upon him--these deems just, and, say, anger refuses
 excited them.

 true, said.

 thinks sufferer wrong, boils
 chafes, side believes justice;
 suffers hunger cold pain
 determined persevere conquer. noble spirit
 quelled either slays slain; hears voice
 shepherd, is, reason, bidding dog bark more.

 illustration perfect, replied; state,
 saying, auxiliaries dogs, hear voice
 rulers, shepherds.

 perceive, said, quite understand me; is, however,
 point wish consider.

 point?

 remember passion spirit appeared first sight kind
 desire, say quite contrary; conflict
 soul spirit arrayed side rational principle.

 assuredly.

 question arises: passion different reason also,
 kind reason; latter case, instead three principles
 soul, two, rational concupiscent;
 rather, state composed three classes, traders,
 auxiliaries, counsellors, may individual soul
 third element passion spirit, corrupted bad
 education natural auxiliary reason?

 yes, said, must third.

 yes, replied, passion, already shown different
 desire, turn also different reason.

 easily proved:--we may observe even young children
 full spirit almost soon born, whereas
 never seem attain use reason, late
 enough.

 excellent, said, may see passion equally brute animals,
 proof truth saying. may
 appeal words homer, already quoted
 us,

 'he smote breast, thus rebuked soul,'

 verse homer clearly supposed power reasons
 better worse different unreasoning anger
 rebuked it.

 true, said.

 so, much tossing, reached land, fairly agreed
 principles exist state exist also
 individual, three number.

 exactly.

 must infer individual wise way,
 virtue quality makes state wise?

 certainly.

 also quality constitutes courage state
 constitutes courage individual, state
 individual bear relation virtues?

 assuredly.

 individual acknowledged us way
 state just?

 follows, course.

 cannot remember justice state consisted
 three classes work class?

 likely forgotten, said.

 must recollect individual several qualities
 nature work just, work?

 yes, said, must remember too.

 ought rational principle, wise, care
 whole soul, rule, passionate spirited principle
 subject ally?

 certainly.

 and, saying, united influence music gymnastic
 bring accord, nerving sustaining reason noble
 words lessons, moderating soothing civilizing
 wildness passion harmony rhythm?

 quite true, said.

 two, thus nurtured educated, learned truly
 know functions, rule concupiscent,
 us largest part soul nature insatiable
 gain; keep guard, lest, waxing great strong
 fulness bodily pleasures, termed, concupiscent
 soul, longer confined sphere, attempt enslave
 rule natural-born subjects, overturn
 whole life man?

 true, said.

 together best defenders whole soul
 whole body attacks without; one counselling,
 fighting leader, courageously executing
 commands counsels?

 true.

 deemed courageous whose spirit retains pleasure
 pain commands reason ought ought fear?

 right, replied.

 call wise little part rules,
 proclaims commands; part supposed
 knowledge interest three parts
 whole?

 assuredly.

 would say temperate elements
 friendly harmony, one ruling principle reason,
 two subject ones spirit desire equally agreed reason
 ought rule, rebel?

 certainly, said, true account temperance whether
 state individual.

 surely, said, explained virtue
 quality man just.

 certain.

 justice dimmer individual, form different,
 found state?

 difference opinion, said.

 because, doubt still lingering minds, commonplace
 instances satisfy us truth saying.

 sort instances mean?

 case put us, must admit state,
 man trained principles state, less
 likely unjust make away deposit gold silver?
 would one deny this?

 one, replied.

 man citizen ever guilty sacrilege theft,
 treachery either friends country?

 never.

 neither ever break faith oaths
 agreements?

 impossible.

 one less likely commit adultery, dishonour
 father mother, fail religious duties?

 one.

 reason part business,
 whether ruling ruled?

 exactly so.

 satisfied quality makes men
 states justice, hope discover other?

 i, indeed.

 dream realized; suspicion entertained
 beginning work construction, divine power

 verified?

 yes, certainly.

 division labour required carpenter
 shoemaker rest citizens

 clearly.

 reality justice describing, concerned
 however, outward man, inward,
 true self concernment man: man permit
 several elements within interfere one another,
 work others,--he sets order inner life,

 time impairs condition, call unjust action,
 opinion presides ignorance.

 said exact truth, socrates.

 good; affirm discovered man
 state, nature justice them,
 telling falsehood?

 certainly not.

 may say so, then?

 let us say so.

 now, said, injustice considered.

 clearly.

 must injustice strife arises among three
 principles--a meddlesomeness, interference, rising part
 soul whole, assertion unlawful authority,
 made rebellious subject true prince,
 natural vassal,--what confusion delusion injustice,
 intemperance cowardice ignorance, every form vice?

 exactly so.

 nature justice injustice known, meaning
 acting unjustly unjust, or, again, acting justly, also
 perfectly clear?

 mean? said.

 why, said, like disease health; soul
 disease health body.

 so? said.

 why, said, healthy causes health,
 unhealthy causes disease.

 yes.

 actions cause justice, unjust actions cause injustice?

 certain.

 creation health institution natural order
 government one another parts body; creation

 true.

 creation justice institution natural order

 creation injustice production state things variance

 exactly so, said.

 virtue health beauty well-being soul,

 true.

 good practices lead virtue, evil practices vice?

 assuredly.

 still old question comparative advantage justice

 said, argument seems reached height which,

 wise men assign hearing discourses. never mind
 us; take heart answer question way:
 sort community women children prevail

 yes, simple friend, answer reverse easy; many
 doubts arise previous conclusions.
 practicability said may doubted; looked another

 fear not, replied, audience hard upon you;

 said: good friend, suppose mean encourage

 easy question answer asked suddenly; shall
 beg draw case side.

 objections, glaucon, many others like
 kind, foresaw long ago; made afraid reluctant

 children.

 zeus, said, problem solved anything easy.

 yes, said, fact man depth,
 whether fallen little swimming bath mid ocean,

 true.

 must swim try reach shore: hope
 arion's dolphin miraculous help may save us?

 suppose so, said.

 well then, let us see way escape found.
 acknowledged--did not? different natures ought different
 pursuits, men's women's natures different.
 saying?--that different natures ought
 pursuits,--this inconsistency charged upon us.

 precisely.

 verily, glaucon, said, glorious power art
 contradiction!

 say so?

 think many man falls practice
 will. thinks reasoning really disputing,
 cannot define divide, know
 speaking; pursue merely verbal opposition spirit
 contention fair discussion.

 yes, replied, often case;
 us argument?

 great deal; certainly danger getting
 unintentionally verbal opposition.

 way?

 valiantly pugnaciously insist upon verbal truth,
 different natures ought different pursuits, never
 considered meaning sameness difference
 nature, distinguished assigned different pursuits
 different natures natures.

 why, no, said, never considered us.

 said: suppose way illustration ask question
 whether opposition nature bald men hairy
 men; admitted us, then, bald men cobblers,
 forbid hairy men cobblers, conversely?

 would jest, said.

 yes, said, jest; why? never meant constructed
 state, opposition natures extend every
 difference, differences affected pursuit

 true.

 whereas physician carpenter different natures?

 certainly.

 if, said, male female sex appear differ

 consists women bearing men begetting children,
 amount proof woman differs man respect

 true, said.

 next, shall ask opponent how, reference pursuits
 arts civic life, nature woman differs man?

 quite fair.

 perhaps he, like yourself, reply give sufficient
 answer instant easy; little reflection
 difficulty.

 yes, perhaps.

 suppose invite accompany us argument,
 may hope show nothing peculiar

 means.

 let us say him: come now, ask question:--when
 spoke nature gifted gifted respect, mean
 say one man acquire thing easily, another difficulty;
 little learning lead one discover great deal; whereas
 other, much study application, sooner learns
 forgets; again, mean, one body
 good servant mind, body hindrance
 him?--would sort differences distinguish
 man gifted nature one ungifted?

 one deny that.

 mention pursuit mankind male sex
 gifts qualities higher degree female? need
 waste time speaking art weaving, management
 pancakes preserves, womankind really appear
 great, beaten man things
 absurd?

 quite right, replied, maintaining general inferiority
 female sex: although many women many things superior
 many men, yet whole say true.

 so, friend, said, special faculty
 administration state woman woman,
 man virtue sex, gifts nature alike
 diffused both; pursuits men pursuits women
 also, woman inferior man.

 true.

 impose enactments men none
 women?

 never do.

 one woman gift healing, another not; one musician,
 another music nature?

 true.

 one woman turn gymnastic military exercises,
 another unwarlike hates gymnastics?

 certainly.

 one woman philosopher, another enemy philosophy;
 one spirit, another without spirit?

 also true.

 one woman temper guardian, another not.
 selection male guardians determined differences
 sort?

 yes.

 men women alike possess qualities make guardian;
 differ comparative strength weakness.

 obviously.

 women qualities selected
 companions colleagues men similar qualities
 resemble capacity character?

 true.

 ought natures pursuits?

 ought.

 then, saying before, nothing unnatural assigning
 music gymnastic wives guardians--to point come
 round again.

 certainly not.

 law enacted agreeable nature, therefore
 impossibility mere aspiration; contrary practice,
 prevails present, reality violation nature.

 appears true.

 consider, first, whether proposals possible,
 secondly whether beneficial?

 yes.

 possibility acknowledged?

 yes.

 great benefit next established?

 quite so.

 admit education makes man good guardian
 make woman good guardian; original nature
 same?

 yes.

 like ask question.

 it?

 would say men equal excellence, one man better
 another?

 latter.

 commonwealth founding conceive
 guardians brought model system
 perfect men, cobblers whose education cobbling?

 ridiculous question!

 answered me, replied: well, may say
 guardians best citizens?

 far best.

 wives best women?

 yes, far best.

 anything better interests state
 men women state good possible?

 nothing better.

 arts music gymnastic, present
 manner described, accomplish?

 certainly.

 made enactment possible highest
 degree beneficial state?

 true.

 let wives guardians strip, virtue
 robe, let share toils war defence
 country; distribution labours lighter
 assigned women, weaker natures, respects
 duties same. man laughs naked
 women exercising bodies best motives, laughter
 plucking

 'a fruit unripe wisdom,'

 ignorant laughing at,
 about;--for is, ever be, best sayings,
 useful noble hurtful base.

 true.

 here, then, one difficulty law women, may say
 escaped; wave swallowed us alive
 enacting guardians either sex
 pursuits common; utility also possibility
 arrangement consistency argument bears witness.

 yes, mighty wave escaped.

 yes, said, greater coming; think much
 see next.

 go on; let see.

 law, said, sequel
 preceded, following effect,--'that wives guardians
 common, children common, parent
 know child, child parent.'

 yes, said, much greater wave other;
 possibility well utility law far
 questionable.

 think, said, dispute
 great utility wives children common; possibility
 quite another matter, much disputed.

 think good many doubts may raised both.

 imply two questions must combined, replied.
 meant admit utility; way, thought,
 escape one them, would remain
 possibility.

 little attempt detected, therefore please
 give defence both.

 well, said, submit fate. yet grant little favour: let
 feast mind dream day dreamers habit
 feasting walking alone;
 discovered means effecting wishes--that matter
 never troubles them--they would rather tire thinking
 possibilities; assuming desire already
 granted them, proceed plan, delight detailing
 mean wish come true--that way
 much good capacity never good
 much. beginning lose heart, like,
 permission, pass question possibility present.
 assuming therefore possibility proposal, shall proceed
 enquire rulers carry arrangements, shall
 demonstrate plan, executed, greatest benefit
 state guardians. first all, then,
 objection, endeavour help consider advantages
 measure; hereafter question possibility.

 objection; proceed.

 first, think rulers auxiliaries worthy
 name bear, must willingness obey
 one power command other; guardians must
 obey laws, must also imitate spirit
 details entrusted care.

 right, said.

 you, said, legislator, selected men,
 select women give them;--they must far possible
 like natures them; must live common houses meet
 common meals. none anything specially
 own; together, brought together,
 associate gymnastic exercises. drawn
 necessity natures intercourse
 other--necessity strong word, think?

 yes, said;--necessity, geometrical, another sort necessity
 lovers know, far convincing constraining
 mass mankind.

 true, said; this, glaucon, like rest, must proceed
 orderly fashion; city blessed, licentiousness
 unholy thing rulers forbid.

 yes, said, ought permitted.

 clearly next thing make matrimony sacred
 highest degree, beneficial deemed sacred?

 exactly.

 marriages made beneficial?--that question
 put you, see house dogs hunting,
 nobler sort birds few. now, beseech you, tell me,
 ever attended pairing breeding?

 particulars?

 why, first place, although good sort,
 better others?

 true.

 breed indifferently, take care
 breed best only?

 best.

 take oldest youngest, ripe age?

 choose ripe age.

 care taken breeding, dogs birds would
 greatly deteriorate?

 certainly.

 horses animals general?

 undoubtedly.

 good heavens! dear friend, said, consummate skill
 rulers need principle holds human species!

 certainly, principle holds; involve
 particular skill?

 because, said, rulers often practise upon body
 corporate medicines. know patients require
 medicines, put regimen, inferior sort
 practitioner deemed good enough; medicine
 given, doctor man.

 quite true, said; alluding?

 mean, replied, rulers find considerable dose
 falsehood deceit necessary good subjects:
 saying use things regarded medicines might
 advantage.

 right.

 lawful use seems likely often needed
 regulations marriages births.

 so?

 why, said, principle already laid best
 either sex united best often, inferior
 inferior, seldom possible; rear
 offspring one sort union, other, flock
 maintained first-rate condition. goings must
 secret rulers know,
 danger herd, guardians may termed, breaking
 rebellion.

 true.

 better appoint certain festivals bring
 together brides bridegrooms, sacrifices offered
 suitable hymeneal songs composed poets: number weddings
 matter must left discretion rulers, whose aim
 preserve average population? many
 things consider, effects wars
 diseases similar agencies, order far possible
 prevent state becoming either large small.

 certainly, replied.

 shall invent ingenious kind lots less
 worthy may draw occasion bringing together,
 accuse ill-luck rulers.

 sure, said.

 think braver better youth, besides
 honours rewards, might greater facilities intercourse
 women given them; bravery reason, fathers ought
 many sons possible.

 true.

 proper officers, whether male female both, offices
 held women well men--

 yes--

 proper officers take offspring good parents
 pen fold, deposit certain nurses
 dwell separate quarter; offspring inferior,
 better chance deformed, put away
 mysterious, unknown place, be.

 yes, said, must done breed guardians
 kept pure.

 provide nurture, bring mothers
 fold full milk, taking greatest possible care
 mother recognises child; wet-nurses may engaged
 required. care also taken process
 suckling shall protracted long; mothers
 getting night trouble, hand sort
 thing nurses attendants.

 suppose wives guardians fine easy time
 children.

 why, said i, ought. let us, however, proceed
 scheme. saying parents prime life?

 true.

 prime life? may defined period
 twenty years woman's life, thirty man's?

 years mean include?

 woman, said, twenty years age may begin bear children
 state, continue bear forty; man may begin
 five-and-twenty, passed point pulse life
 beats quickest, continue beget children fifty-five.

 certainly, said, men women years prime
 physical well intellectual vigour.

 one prescribed ages takes part public
 hymeneals shall said done unholy unrighteous thing;
 child father, steals life,
 conceived auspices unlike sacrifices prayers,
 hymeneal priestesses priest whole city
 offer, new generation may better useful
 good useful parents, whereas child offspring
 darkness strange lust.

 true, replied.

 law apply one within prescribed
 age forms connection woman prime life without
 sanction rulers; shall say raising
 bastard state, uncertified unconsecrated.

 true, replied.

 applies, however, within specified age:
 allow range will, except man may
 marry daughter daughter's daughter, mother
 mother's mother; women, hand, prohibited
 marrying sons fathers, son's son father's father,
 either direction. grant this, accompanying
 permission strict orders prevent embryo may come
 seeing light; force way birth,
 parents must understand offspring union cannot
 maintained, arrange accordingly.

 also, said, reasonable proposition. know
 fathers daughters, on?

 never know. way this:--dating day
 hymeneal, bridegroom married call male
 children born seventh tenth month afterwards
 sons, female children daughters, call
 father, call children grandchildren,
 call elder generation grandfathers grandmothers.
 begotten time fathers mothers came together
 called brothers sisters, these, saying,
 forbidden inter-marry. this, however, understood
 absolute prohibition marriage brothers sisters;
 lot favours them, receive sanction pythian oracle,
 law allow them.

 quite right, replied.

 scheme, glaucon, according guardians
 state wives families common. would
 argument show community consistent rest
 polity, also nothing better--would not?

 yes, certainly.

 shall try find common basis asking ought
 chief aim legislator making laws
 organization state,--what greatest good,
 greatest evil, consider whether previous description
 stamp good evil?

 means.

 greater evil discord distraction plurality
 unity ought reign? greater good bond unity?

 cannot.

 unity community pleasures
 pains--where citizens glad grieved occasions
 joy sorrow?

 doubt.

 yes; common private feeling state
 disorganized--when one half world triumphing
 plunged grief events happening city
 citizens?

 certainly.

 differences commonly originate disagreement use
 terms 'mine' 'not mine,' 'his' 'not his.'

 exactly so.

 best-ordered state greatest number
 persons apply terms 'mine' 'not mine' way
 thing?

 quite true.

 nearly approaches condition
 individual--as body, finger one us hurt,
 whole frame, drawn towards soul centre forming one kingdom
 ruling power therein, feels hurt sympathizes
 together part affected, say man pain
 finger; expression used part
 body, sensation pain suffering pleasure
 alleviation suffering.

 true, replied; agree best-ordered
 state nearest approach common feeling
 describe.

 one citizens experiences good evil,
 whole state make case own, either rejoice
 sorrow him?

 yes, said, happen well-ordered state.

 time, said, us return state see
 whether form accordance
 fundamental principles.

 good.

 state like every rulers subjects?

 true.

 call one another citizens?

 course.

 another name people give rulers
 states?

 generally call masters, democratic states simply
 call rulers.

 state name besides citizens people
 give rulers?

 called saviours helpers, replied.

 rulers call people?

 maintainers foster-fathers.

 call states?

 slaves.

 rulers call one another states?

 fellow-rulers.

 ours?

 fellow-guardians.

 ever know example state ruler would
 speak one colleagues friend another
 friend?

 yes, often.

 friend regards describes one
 interest, stranger interest?

 exactly.

 would guardians think speak guardian
 stranger?

 certainly would not; every one meet regarded
 either brother sister, father mother, son
 daughter, child parent thus connected
 him.

 capital, said; let ask more: shall family
 name only; shall actions true name?
 example, use word 'father,' would care father
 implied filial reverence duty obedience
 law commands; violator duties regarded
 impious unrighteous person likely receive much good
 either hands god man?
 strains children hear repeated ears
 citizens intimated parents
 rest kinsfolk?

 these, said, none other; ridiculous
 utter names family ties lips act
 spirit them?

 city language harmony concord often
 heard other. describing before, one
 well ill, universal word 'with well' 'it
 ill.'

 true.

 agreeably mode thinking speaking, saying
 pleasures pains common?

 yes, will.

 common interest thing
 alike call 'my own,' common interest
 common feeling pleasure pain?

 yes, far states.

 reason this, general constitution
 state, guardians community women
 children?

 chief reason.

 unity feeling admitted greatest good,
 implied comparison well-ordered state relation
 body members, affected pleasure pain?

 acknowledged, rightly.

 community wives children among citizens clearly
 source greatest good state?

 certainly.

 agrees principle affirming,--that
 guardians houses lands property;
 pay food, receive
 citizens, private expenses;
 intended preserve true character guardians.

 right, replied.

 community property community families,
 saying, tend make truly guardians; tear
 city pieces differing 'mine' 'not mine;' man
 dragging acquisition made separate house
 own, separate wife children private pleasures
 pains; affected far may pleasures
 pains one opinion near
 dear them, therefore tend towards common end.

 certainly, replied.

 nothing persons call
 own, suits complaints existence among them;
 delivered quarrels money children
 relations occasion.

 course will.

 neither trials assault insult ever likely occur among
 them. equals defend equals shall
 maintain honourable right; shall make protection
 person matter necessity.

 good, said.

 yes; good law; viz. man
 quarrel another satisfy resentment there,
 proceed dangerous lengths.

 certainly.

 elder shall assigned duty ruling chastising
 younger.

 clearly.

 doubt younger strike
 violence elder, unless magistrates command him;
 slight way. two guardians, shame fear,
 mighty prevent him: shame, makes men refrain laying hands
 relation parents; fear,
 injured one succoured others brothers, sons,
 fathers.

 true, replied.

 every way laws help citizens keep peace
 one another?

 yes, want peace.

 guardians never quarrel among
 danger rest city divided either
 one another.

 none whatever.

 hardly like even mention little meannesses
 rid, beneath notice: such, example,
 flattery rich poor, pains pangs
 men experience bringing family, finding money buy
 necessaries household, borrowing repudiating, getting
 can, giving money hands women slaves
 keep--the many evils many kinds people suffer way
 mean enough obvious enough, worth speaking of.

 yes, said, man need eyes order perceive that.

 evils delivered, life
 blessed life olympic victors yet blessed.

 so?

 olympic victor, said, deemed happy receiving part
 blessedness secured citizens,
 glorious victory complete maintenance public
 cost. victory salvation whole
 state; crown children crowned
 fulness life needs; receive rewards
 hands country living, death honourable
 burial.

 yes, said, glorious rewards are.

 remember, said, course previous discussion
 one shall nameless accused us making guardians
 unhappy--they nothing might possessed things--to
 replied that, occasion offered, might perhaps hereafter
 consider question, that, present advised, would make
 guardians truly guardians, fashioning state
 view greatest happiness, particular class,
 whole?

 yes, remember.

 say, life protectors made
 far better nobler olympic victors--is life
 shoemakers, artisans, husbandmen, compared
 it?

 certainly not.

 time ought repeat said elsewhere,
 guardians shall try happy manner
 cease guardian, content safe
 harmonious life, which, judgment, lives best,
 infatuated youthful conceit happiness gets
 head shall seek appropriate whole state himself,
 learn wisely hesiod spoke, said, 'half
 whole.'

 consult me, say him: stay are,
 offer life.

 agree then, said, men women common way
 life described--common education, common children;
 watch citizens common whether abiding
 city going war; keep watch together, hunt
 together like dogs; always things, far
 able, women share men?
 best, violate, preserve natural relation
 sexes.

 agree you, replied.

 enquiry, said, yet made, whether community
 found possible--as among animals, also among men--and
 possible, way possible?

 anticipated question suggest.

 difficulty, said, seeing war carried
 them.

 how?

 why, course go expeditions together; take
 children strong enough, that, manner
 artisan's child, may look work
 grown up; besides looking
 help use war, wait upon fathers
 mothers. never observe arts potters' boys look
 help, long touch wheel?

 yes, have.

 shall potters careful educating children
 giving opportunity seeing practising duties
 guardians be?

 idea ridiculous, said.

 also effect parents, whom,
 animals, presence young ones greatest incentive
 valour.

 quite true, socrates; yet defeated, may
 often happen war, great danger is! children lost
 well parents, state never recover.

 true, said; would never allow run risk?

 far saying that.

 well, ever run risk
 occasion when, escape disaster, better it?

 clearly.

 whether future soldiers see war days
 youth important matter, sake risk may
 fairly incurred.

 yes, important.

 must first step,--to make children spectators
 war; must also contrive shall secured
 danger; well.

 true.

 parents may supposed blind risks war,
 know, far human foresight can, expeditions safe
 dangerous?

 may assumed.

 take safe expeditions cautious
 dangerous ones?

 true.

 place command experienced veterans
 leaders teachers?

 properly.

 still, dangers war cannot always foreseen; good
 deal chance them?

 true.

 chances children must furnished

 mean? said.

 mean must mount horses earliest youth,
 learnt ride, take horseback see war:
 horses must spirited warlike, tractable yet
 swiftest had. way get excellent

 danger follow elder leaders escape.

 believe right, said.

 next, war; relations soldiers one

 act cowardice, degraded rank husbandman

 means, say.

 allows taken prisoner may well made

 certainly.

 hero distinguished himself, shall done
 him? first place, shall receive honour army
 youthful comrades; every one succession shall crown him.
 say?

 approve.

 say receiving right hand fellowship?

 too, agree.

 hardly agree next proposal.

 proposal?

 kiss kissed them.

 certainly, disposed go further, say: let
 one mind kiss refuse kissed
 expedition lasts. lover army, whether
 love youth maiden, may eager win prize
 valour.

 capital, said. brave man wives others
 already determined: first choices
 matters others, order may many children
 possible?

 agreed.

 again, another manner which, according homer, brave
 youths honoured; tells ajax,
 distinguished battle, rewarded long chines,
 seems compliment appropriate hero flower age,
 tribute honour also strengthening thing.

 true, said.

 this, said, homer shall teacher; too,
 sacrifices like occasions, honour brave according
 measure valour, whether men women, hymns
 distinctions mentioning; also

 'seats precedence, meats full cups;'

 honouring them, shall time training them.

 that, replied, excellent.

 yes, said; man dies gloriously war shall say,
 first place, golden race?

 sure.

 nay, authority hesiod affirming

 'they holy angels upon earth, authors good, averters evil,

 yes; accept authority.

 means.

 ages come reverence kneel

 deemed pre-eminently good, whether die age,
 way, shall admitted honours.

 right, said.

 next, shall soldiers treat enemies? this?

 respect mean?

 first all, regard slavery? think right hellenes
 enslave hellenic states, allow others enslave them,
 help? custom spare them, considering
 danger whole race may one day fall
 yoke barbarians?

 spare infinitely better.

 hellene owned slave; rule
 observe advise hellenes observe.

 certainly, said; way united
 barbarians keep hands one another.

 next slain; ought conquerors, said, take anything
 armour? practice despoiling enemy afford
 excuse facing battle? cowards skulk dead,
 pretending fulfilling duty, many army
 lost love plunder.

 true.

 illiberality avarice robbing corpse, also
 degree meanness womanishness making enemy dead
 body real enemy flown away left fighting
 gear behind him,--is rather like dog cannot get
 assailant, quarrelling stones strike instead?

 like dog, said.

 must abstain spoiling dead hindering burial?

 yes, replied, certainly must.

 neither shall offer arms temples gods, least
 arms hellenes, care maintain good feeling
 hellenes; and, indeed, reason fear offering
 spoils taken kinsmen may pollution unless commanded god
 himself?

 true.

 again, devastation hellenic territory burning
 houses, practice?

 may pleasure, said, hearing opinion?

 forbidden, judgment; would take annual
 produce more. shall tell why?

 pray do.

 why, see, difference names 'discord' 'war,'
 imagine also difference natures; one
 expressive internal domestic,
 external foreign; first two termed discord,
 second, war.

 proper distinction, replied.

 may observe equal propriety hellenic race
 united together ties blood friendship, alien strange
 barbarians?

 good, said.

 therefore hellenes fight barbarians barbarians
 hellenes, described us war fight,
 nature enemies, kind antagonism called war;
 hellenes fight one another shall say hellas
 state disorder discord, nature friends;
 enmity called discord.

 agree.

 consider then, said, acknowledged
 discord occurs, city divided, parties destroy lands
 burn houses one another, wicked strife appear!
 true lover country would bring tear pieces
 nurse mother: might reason conqueror depriving
 conquered harvest, still would idea
 peace hearts would mean go fighting ever.

 yes, said, better temper other.

 city, founding, hellenic city?

 ought be, replied.

 citizens good civilized?

 yes, civilized.

 lovers hellas, think hellas
 land, share common temples?

 certainly.

 difference arises among regarded
 discord only--a quarrel among friends, called war?

 certainly not.

 quarrel intend day reconciled?

 certainly.

 use friendly correction, enslave destroy
 opponents; correctors, enemies?

 so.

 hellenes devastate hellas,
 burn houses, ever suppose whole population
 city--men, women, children--are equally enemies, know
 guilt war always confined persons
 many friends. reasons unwilling
 waste lands rase houses; enmity
 last many innocent sufferers compelled guilty
 give satisfaction?

 agree, said, citizens thus deal hellenic
 enemies; barbarians hellenes deal one another.

 let us enact law also guardians:--that
 neither devastate lands hellenes burn houses.

 agreed; may agree also thinking these, like
 previous enactments, good.

 still must say, socrates, allowed go
 way entirely forget question
 commencement discussion thrust aside:--is order
 things possible, how, all? quite ready acknowledge

 advantages many please, state

 let begin reminding found way hither search

 approximation enough.

 agree.

 yes, will.

 let next endeavour show fault states

 then, said, go meet liken greatest

 true.

 guardian then, said, must required take longer circuit,

 yes, said, is. virtues must behold
 outline merely, present--nothing short finished

 infinity pains, order may appear full beauty
 utmost clearness, ridiculous think
 highest truths worthy attaining highest accuracy!

 right noble thought; suppose shall refrain
 asking highest knowledge?

 nay, said, ask will; certain heard

 rather think, disposed troublesome; often
 told idea good highest knowledge,
 things become useful advantageous use this.
 hardly ignorant speak, concerning
 which, often heard say, know little; and, without
 which, knowledge possession kind profit us
 nothing. think possession things
 value possess good? knowledge
 things knowledge beauty goodness?

 assuredly not.

 aware people affirm pleasure good,
 finer sort wits say knowledge?

 yes.

 aware latter cannot explain mean
 knowledge, obliged say knowledge good?

 ridiculous!

 yes, said, begin reproaching us ignorance
 good, presume knowledge it--for good
 define knowledge good, understood

 true, said.

 make pleasure good equal perplexity;
 compelled admit bad pleasures well good.

 certainly.

 therefore acknowledge bad good same?

 true.

 none.

 further, see many willing seem

 true, socrates; must say one like passed

 not, said, assurance positive certainty; right
 that: may say thinks, matter opinion.

 true.

 still, must implore you, socrates, said glaucon, turn away

 yes, friend, shall least equally satisfied, cannot

 no.

 certainly.

 soul like eye: resting upon truth

 so.

 now, imparts truth known power knowing

 thus:--there two subdivisions, lower soul uses

 question, said.

 entire allegory, said, may append, dear glaucon,
 previous argument; prison-house world sight, light

 moreover, said, must wonder attain
 beatific vision unwilling descend human affairs;
 souls ever hastening upper world desire

 yes, natural.

 anything surprising one passes divine
 contemplations evil state man, misbehaving
 ridiculous manner; if, eyes blinking
 become accustomed surrounding darkness, compelled fight
 courts law, places, images shadows
 images justice, endeavouring meet conceptions
 never yet seen absolute justice?

 anything surprising, replied.

 one common sense remember bewilderments
 eyes two kinds, arise two causes, either coming
 light going light, true mind's
 eye, quite much bodily eye; remembers
 sees one whose vision perplexed weak,
 ready laugh; first ask whether soul man come
 brighter life, unable see unaccustomed

 soul comes light, reason

 that, said, distinction.

 then, right, certain professors education must wrong
 say put knowledge soul
 before, like sight blind eyes.

 undoubtedly say this, replied.

 whereas, argument shows power capacity learning
 exists soul already; eye unable turn
 darkness light without whole body, instrument
 knowledge movement whole soul turned
 world becoming being, learn degrees endure
 sight being, brightest best being,
 words, good.

 true.

 must art effect conversion

 looking away truth?

 yes, said, art may presumed.

 whereas so-called virtues soul seem akin
 bodily qualities, even originally innate
 implanted later habit exercise, virtue wisdom
 anything else contains divine element always remains,
 conversion rendered useful profitable; or,
 hand, hurtful useless. never observe narrow intelligence

 true, said.

 music, said, remember, counterpart gymnastic,

 undoubtedly; yet music gymnastic excluded, arts

 well, said, may nothing left special subjects;

 something arts sciences intelligences use common,
 every one first learn among elements education.

 that?

 little matter distinguishing one, two, three--in word,

 partake them?

 yes.

 art war partakes them?

 sure.

 speaking uninviting objects, mean pass

 it?

 equally appears finger, whether seen middle

 true.

 now, suppose person say them: friends,
 wonderful numbers reasoning, which, say,

 would answer, conceive, speaking

 yes; marked characteristic it.

 observed, natural talent

 even dull, arithmetical training, although

 true, said.

 indeed, easily find difficult study,

 not.

 and, reasons, arithmetic kind knowledge
 best natures trained, must given up.

 agree.

 let made one subjects education. next, shall
 enquire whether kindred science also concerns us?

 mean geometry?

 exactly so.

 clearly, said, concerned part geometry
 relates war; pitching camp, taking position,
 closing extending lines army, military
 manoeuvre, whether actual battle march, make
 difference whether general geometrician.

 yes, said, purpose little either geometry
 calculation enough; question relates rather greater
 advanced part geometry--whether tends degree

 saying, things tend compel soul turn gaze towards

 true, said.

 geometry compels us view being, concerns us; becoming
 only, concern us?

 yes, assert.

 yet anybody least acquaintance geometry deny

 so?

 view practice only, always speaking, narrow
 ridiculous manner, squaring extending applying
 like--they confuse necessities geometry daily life;
 whereas knowledge real object whole science.

 certainly, said.

 must admission made?

 admission?

 knowledge geometry aims knowledge eternal,
 aught perishing transient.

 that, replied, may readily allowed, true.

 then, noble friend, geometry draw soul towards truth,
 create spirit philosophy, raise
 unhappily allowed fall down.

 nothing likely effect.

 nothing sternly laid inhabitants

 mistake? said.

 plane geometry, said, proceeded solids

 true, socrates; little seems known yet
 subjects.

 why, yes, said, two reasons:--in first place,
 government patronises them; leads want energy
 pursuit them, difficult; second place, students
 cannot learn unless director. director
 hardly found, even could, matters stand,
 students, conceited, would attend him. that,
 however, would otherwise whole state became director
 studies gave honour them; disciples would want

 yes, said, remarkable charm them. clearly

 yes, said.

 placed astronomy next, made step backward?

 yes, delayed hurry; ludicrous state solid

 true, said.

 assuming science omitted would come existence

 right order, replied. now, socrates, rebuked

 astronomy compels soul look upwards leads us world

 every one myself, said; every one else may clear,
 me.

 would say?

 rather say elevate astronomy philosophy
 appear make us look downwards upwards.

 mean? asked.

 you, replied, mind truly sublime conception
 knowledge things above. dare say person
 throw head back study fretted ceiling, would still think
 mind percipient, eyes.
 likely right, may simpleton: but, opinion,
 knowledge unseen make soul
 look upwards, whether man gapes heavens blinks
 ground, seeking learn particular sense, would deny
 learn, nothing sort matter science; soul
 looking downwards, upwards, whether way knowledge water
 land, whether floats, lies back.

 acknowledge, said, justice rebuke. still, like
 ascertain astronomy learned manner conducive
 knowledge speaking?

 tell you, said: starry heaven behold wrought
 upon visible ground, therefore, although fairest
 perfect visible things, must necessarily deemed inferior far
 true motions absolute swiftness absolute slowness,
 relative other, carry contained

 apprehended reason intelligence, sight.

 true, replied.

 spangled heavens used pattern view

 appreciate exquisiteness workmanship, would never
 dream thinking could find true equal true
 double, truth proportion.

 no, replied, idea would ridiculous.

 true astronomer feeling looks

 heaven framed creator perfect manner?
 never imagine proportions night day,
 month, month year, stars

 also eternal subject deviation--that would absurd;
 equally absurd take much pains investigating
 exact truth.

 quite agree, though never thought before.

 then, said, astronomy, geometry, employ problems,

 yes, can, will, said.

 question, said, easily answered: four governments

 way viewing judging matter suitable.

 first, then, said, let us enquire timocracy (the government
 honour) arises aristocracy (the government best). clearly,
 political changes originate divisions actual governing
 power; government united, however small, cannot moved.

 true, said.

 two classes auxiliaries rulers disagree among

 us 'how discord first arose'? shall imagine solemn mockery,

 would address us?

 manner:--a city thus constituted hardly

 new government thus arises form intermediate

 true.

 change, change made,
 proceed? clearly, new state, mean oligarchy
 perfect state, partly follow one partly other,
 also peculiarities.

 true, said.

 honour given rulers, abstinence warrior class
 agriculture, handicrafts, trade general, institution
 common meals, attention paid gymnastics military
 training--in respects state resemble former.

 true.

 fear admitting philosophers power,
 longer simple earnest, made mixed elements;
 turning passionate less complex characters,
 nature fitted war rather peace; value set
 upon military stratagems contrivances, waging
 everlasting wars--this state part peculiar.

 yes.

 yes, said; men stamp covetous money, like
 live oligarchies; have, fierce secret longing
 gold silver, hoard dark places, magazines
 treasuries deposit concealment them;
 also castles nests eggs,
 spend large sums wives, others please.

 true, said.

 miserly means openly acquiring
 money prize; spend another man's
 gratification desires, stealing pleasures running
 away like children law, father: schooled
 gentle influences force, neglected
 true muse, companion reason philosophy,

 undoubtedly, said, form government describe

 why, mixture, said; one thing, one thing only,
 predominantly seen,--the spirit contention ambition;
 due prevalence passionate spirited element.

 assuredly, said.

 true, replied.

 man answers form government-how come
 being, like?

 think, said adeimantus, spirit contention
 characterises him, unlike friend glaucon.

 perhaps, said, may like one point;
 respects different.

 respects?

 self-assertion less cultivated, yet
 friend culture; good listener, speaker.
 person apt rough slaves, unlike educated man,
 proud that; also courteous freemen,
 remarkably obedient authority; lover power lover
 honour; claiming ruler, eloquent,
 ground sort, soldier performed feats
 arms; also lover gymnastic exercises chase.

 yes, type character answers timocracy.

 one despise riches young; gets
 older attracted them,
 piece avaricious nature him, single-minded towards
 virtue, lost best guardian.

 that? said adeimantus.

 philosophy, said, tempered music, comes takes
 abode man, saviour virtue throughout life.

 good, said.

 such, said, timocratical youth, like timocratical
 state.

 exactly.

 origin follows:--he often young son brave father,
 dwells ill-governed city, declines honours
 offices, go law, exert way,
 ready waive rights order may escape trouble.

 son come being?

 character son begins develope hears mother
 complaining husband place government,
 consequence precedence among women.
 further, sees husband eager money,
 instead battling railing law courts assembly, taking
 whatever happens quietly; observes thoughts
 always centre himself, treats considerable
 indifference, annoyed, says son father
 half man far easy-going: adding complaints
 ill-treatment women fond rehearsing.

 yes, said adeimantus, give us plenty them, complaints
 like themselves.

 youth grows must retaliate upon people

 seem described origin perfectly.

 now, said, second form government second
 type character?

 have.

 next, let us look another man who, aeschylus says,

 'is set another state;'

 rather, plan requires, begin state.

 means.

 believe oligarchy follows next order.

 manner government term oligarchy?

 government resting valuation property, rich
 power poor man deprived it.

 understand, replied.

 ought begin describing change timocracy
 oligarchy arises?

 yes.

 well, said, eyes required order see one passes
 other.

 how?

 accumulation gold treasury private individuals
 ruin timocracy; invent illegal modes expenditure;
 wives care law?

 yes, indeed.

 one, seeing another grow rich, seeks rival him, thus
 great mass citizens become lovers money.

 likely enough.

 grow richer richer, think making
 fortune less think virtue; riches virtue
 placed together scales balance, one always rises
 falls.

 true.

 proportion riches rich men honoured state,
 virtue virtuous dishonoured.

 clearly.

 honoured cultivated, honour
 neglected.

 obvious.

 last, instead loving contention glory, men become
 lovers trade money; honour look rich man,
 make ruler him, dishonour poor man.

 so.

 next proceed make law fixes sum money
 qualification citizenship; sum higher one place lower
 another, oligarchy less exclusive; allow
 one whose property falls amount fixed share
 government. changes constitution effect force
 arms, intimidation already done work.

 true.

 this, speaking generally, way oligarchy
 established.

 yes, said; characteristics form
 government, defects speaking?

 first all, said, consider nature qualification.
 think would happen pilots chosen according
 property, poor man refused permission steer, even though
 better pilot?

 mean would shipwreck?

 yes; true government anything?

 imagine so.

 except city?--or would include city?

 nay, said, case city strongest all, inasmuch
 rule city greatest difficult all.

 this, then, first great defect oligarchy?

 clearly.

 another defect quite bad.

 defect?

 inevitable division: state one, two states,
 one poor, rich men; living spot
 always conspiring one another.

 that, surely, least bad.

 another discreditable feature is, that, like reason,
 incapable carrying war. either arm multitude,
 afraid enemy; or,
 call hour battle, oligarchs indeed,
 fight rule. time fondness
 money makes unwilling pay taxes.

 discreditable!

 and, said before, constitution persons
 many callings--they husbandmen, tradesmen, warriors, one.
 look well?

 anything well.

 another evil is, perhaps, greatest all,
 state first begins liable.

 evil?

 man may sell has, another may acquire property;
 yet sale may dwell city longer
 part, neither trader, artisan, horseman, hoplite,
 poor, helpless creature.

 yes, evil also first begins state.

 evil certainly prevented there; oligarchies
 extremes great wealth utter poverty.

 true.

 think again: wealthy days, spending money,
 man sort whit good state purposes
 citizenship? seem member ruling
 body, although truth neither ruler subject,
 spendthrift?

 say, seemed ruler, spendthrift.

 may say drone house like drone
 honeycomb, one plague city
 hive?

 so, socrates.

 god made flying drones, adeimantus, without stings,
 whereas walking drones made without stings others
 dreadful stings; stingless class old
 age end paupers; stingers come criminal class,
 termed.

 true, said.

 clearly then, whenever see paupers state, somewhere
 neighborhood hidden away thieves, cut-purses robbers
 temples, sorts malefactors.

 clearly.

 well, said, oligarchical states find paupers?

 yes, said; nearly everybody pauper ruler.

 may bold affirm also many criminals
 found them, rogues stings, authorities
 careful restrain force?

 certainly, may bold.

 existence persons attributed want education,
 ill-training, evil constitution state?

 true.

 such, then, form evils oligarchy;
 may many evils.

 likely.

 oligarchy, form government rulers

 how?

 miserly savings hard work gets fortune together.

 let us consider whether likeness them.

 certainly.

 expect so.

 surely, miser individually ignoble competitor

 true.

 that, said, method.

 well, said, change oligarchy democracy
 arise? wise?--the good state aims
 become rich possible, desire insatiable?

 then?

 rulers, aware power rests upon wealth, refuse
 curtail law extravagance spendthrift youth

 sure.

 tolerably clear.

 oligarchical states, general spread carelessness
 extravagance, men good family often reduced beggary?

 yes, often.

 still remain city; are, ready sting

 yes, greatly lessened.

 present governors, induced motives named,

 true.

 care making money, indifferent
 pauper cultivation virtue.

 yes, quite indifferent.

 state affairs prevails among them. often rulers
 subjects may come one another's way, whether journey
 occasion meeting, pilgrimage march,
 fellow-soldiers fellow-sailors; aye may observe
 behaviour moment danger--for danger
 is, fear poor despised rich--and
 likely wiry sunburnt poor man may placed battle

 yes, said, quite aware way talking.

 provocation commotion may arise within--in way wherever
 weakness state also likely illness,
 occasion may slight, one party introducing without

 yes, surely.

 democracy comes poor conquered

 manner life, sort government

 freedom frankness--a man may say likes?

 'tis said so, replied.

 freedom is, individual clearly able order

 will.

 this, then, seems likely fairest states, like
 embroidered robe spangled every sort flower.
 women children think variety colours things
 charming, many men state,

 yes.

 yes, good sir, better look

 why?

 liberty reigns there--they complete

 humanity condemned cases quite charming?
 observed how, democracy, many persons, although

 yes, replied, many many one.

 see too, said, forgiving spirit democracy, 'don't

 principles solemnly laid foundation city--as
 said that, except case rarely gifted nature,
 never good man childhood used
 play amid things beauty make joy study--how
 grandly trample fine notions feet,

 yes, noble spirit.

 dispensing sort equality equals unequals alike.

 know well.

 consider now, said, manner man individual is, rather
 consider, case state, comes being.

 good, said.

 way--he son miserly oligarchical
 father trained habits?

 exactly.

 and, like father, keeps force pleasures
 spending getting sort, called
 unnecessary?

 obviously.

 would like, sake clearness, distinguish
 necessary unnecessary pleasures?

 should.

 necessary pleasures cannot get rid,
 satisfaction benefit us? rightly called
 so, framed nature desire beneficial
 necessary, cannot help it.

 true.

 wrong therefore calling necessary?

 not.

 desires man may get rid, takes pains
 youth upwards--of presence, moreover, good,
 cases reverse good--shall right saying
 unnecessary?

 yes, certainly.

 suppose select example either kind, order may
 general notion them?

 good.

 desire eating, is, simple food condiments,
 far required health strength,
 necessary class?

 suppose.

 pleasure eating necessary two ways; us good
 essential continuance life?

 yes.

 condiments necessary far good
 health?

 certainly.

 desire goes beyond this, delicate food,
 luxuries, might generally got rid of, controlled trained
 youth, hurtful body, hurtful soul
 pursuit wisdom virtue, may rightly called unnecessary?

 true.

 may say desires spend, others make money
 conduce production?

 certainly.

 pleasures love, pleasures, holds
 good?

 true.

 drone spoke surfeited pleasures
 desires sort, slave unnecessary desires,
 whereas subject necessary miserly
 oligarchical?

 true.

 again, let us see democratical man grows
 oligarchical: following, suspect, commonly process.

 process?

 young man brought describing,
 vulgar miserly way, tasted drones' honey come
 associate fierce crafty natures able provide
 sorts refinements varieties pleasure--then, may
 imagine, change begin oligarchical principle within
 democratical?

 inevitably.

 city like helping like, change effected
 alliance without assisting one division citizens,
 young man changed class desires coming without
 assist desires within him, akin alike
 helping akin alike?

 certainly.

 ally aids oligarchical principle within
 him, whether influence father kindred, advising
 rebuking him, arises soul faction opposite
 faction, goes war himself.

 must so.

 times democratical principle gives way
 oligarchical, desires die, others banished;
 spirit reverence enters young man's soul order
 restored.

 yes, said, sometimes happens.

 then, again, old desires driven out, fresh ones
 spring up, akin them, father
 know educate them, wax fierce numerous.

 yes, said, apt way.

 draw old associates, holding secret intercourse
 them, breed multiply him.

 true.

 length seize upon citadel young man's soul,
 perceive void accomplishments fair pursuits
 true words, make abode minds men dear

 none better.

 false boastful conceits phrases mount upwards take
 place.

 certain so.

 young man returns country lotus-eaters,

 so.

 let set democracy; may truly called
 democratic man.

 let place, said.

 last comes beautiful all, man state alike,
 tyranny tyrant; consider.

 quite true, said.

 say then, friend, manner tyranny arise?--that
 democratic origin evident.

 clearly.

 tyranny spring democracy manner
 democracy oligarchy--i mean, sort?

 how?

 good oligarchy proposed means
 maintained excess wealth--am right?

 yes.

 insatiable desire wealth neglect things
 sake money-getting also ruin oligarchy?

 true.

 democracy good, insatiable desire brings
 dissolution?

 good?

 freedom, replied; which, tell democracy, glory
 state--and therefore democracy alone freeman
 nature deign dwell.

 yes; saying every body's mouth.

 going observe, insatiable desire
 neglect things introduces change democracy,
 occasions demand tyranny.

 so?

 democracy thirsting freedom evil cup-bearers

 freedom, then, unless rulers amenable give plentiful
 draught, calls account punishes them, says
 cursed oligarchs.

 yes, replied, common occurrence.

 yes, said; loyal citizens insultingly termed slaves

 state, liberty limit?

 certainly not.

 degrees anarchy finds way private houses, ends
 getting among animals infecting them.

 mean?

 mean father grows accustomed descend level
 sons fear them, son level father,
 respect reverence either parents;
 freedom, metic equal citizen citizen
 metic, stranger quite good either.

 yes, said, way.

 evils, said--there several lesser ones:
 state society master fears flatters scholars,
 scholars despise masters tutors; young old
 alike; young man level old, ready
 compete word deed; old men condescend
 young full pleasantry gaiety; loth thought
 morose authoritative, therefore adopt manners
 young.

 quite true, said.

 last extreme popular liberty slave bought money,
 whether male female, free purchaser;
 must forget tell liberty equality two sexes
 relation other.

 yes, said, know well.

 such, friend, said, fair glorious beginning
 springs tyranny.

 glorious indeed, said. next step?

 ruin oligarchy ruin democracy; disease
 magnified intensified liberty overmasters democracy--the truth
 excessive increase anything often causes reaction
 opposite direction; case seasons
 vegetable animal life, forms government.

 true.

 excess liberty, whether states individuals, seems
 pass excess slavery.

 yes, natural order.

 tyranny naturally arises democracy,
 aggravated form tyranny slavery extreme form
 liberty?

 might expect.

 that, however, not, believe, question--you rather desired
 know disorder generated alike oligarchy
 democracy, ruin both?

 so, replied.

 well, said, meant refer class idle spendthrifts,
 courageous leaders timid
 followers, comparing drones, stingless,
 others stings.

 comparison.

 two classes plagues every city
 generated, phlegm bile body. good
 physician lawgiver state ought, like wise bee-master,
 keep distance prevent, possible, ever coming in;
 anyhow found way in,
 cells cut speedily possible.

 yes, means, said.

 then, order may see clearly doing, let us imagine
 democracy divided, indeed is, three classes;
 first place freedom creates rather drones democratic
 oligarchical state.

 true.

 democracy certainly intensified.

 so?

 oligarchical state disqualified driven
 office, therefore cannot train gather strength; whereas
 democracy almost entire ruling power, keener
 sort speak act, rest keep buzzing bema
 suffer word said side; hence democracies almost
 everything managed drones.

 true, said.

 another class always severed mass.

 that?

 orderly class, nation traders sure
 richest.

 naturally so.

 squeezable persons yield largest amount
 honey drones.

 why, said, little squeezed people
 little.

 called wealthy class, drones feed upon them.

 pretty much case, said.

 people third class, consisting work
 hands; politicians, much live upon.
 this, assembled, largest powerful class
 democracy.

 true, said; multitude seldom willing congregate
 unless get little honey.

 share? said. leaders deprive rich
 estates distribute among people; time
 taking care reserve larger part themselves?

 why, yes, said, extent people share.

 persons whose property taken compelled
 defend people best can?

 else do?

 then, although may desire change, others charge

 true.

 end see people, accord,

 oligarchs reality; wish be, sting
 drones torments breeds revolution them.

 exactly truth.

 come impeachments judgments trials one another.

 true.

 people always champion set nurse

 yes, way.

 root tyrant springs; first
 appears ground protector.

 yes, quite clear.

 protector begin change tyrant? clearly
 man said tale arcadian temple

 tale?

 tale tasted entrails single human victim
 minced entrails victims destined become
 wolf. never hear it?

 oh, yes.

 protector people like him; mob entirely
 disposal, restrained shedding blood kinsmen;
 favourite method false accusation brings court
 murders them, making life man disappear, unholy
 tongue lips tasting blood fellow citizens; kills
 others banishes, time hinting abolition
 debts partition lands: this, destiny?
 must either perish hands enemies,
 man become wolf--that is, tyrant?

 inevitably.

 this, said, begins make party rich?

 same.

 driven out, comes back, spite enemies,
 tyrant full grown.

 clear.

 unable expel him, get condemned death

 yes, said, usual way.

 comes famous request body-guard, device
 got thus far tyrannical career--'let
 people's friend,' say, 'be lost them.'

 exactly.

 people readily assent; fears him--they none
 themselves.

 true.

 chariot state reins hand, longer protector,
 tyrant absolute.

 doubt, said.

 let us consider happiness man, also state

 yes, said, let us consider that.

 first, early days power, full smiles,
 salutes every one meets;--he called tyrant,
 making promises public also private! liberating debtors,
 distributing land people followers, wanting
 kind good every one!

 course, said.

 disposed foreign enemies conquest treaty,
 nothing fear them, always stirring
 war other, order people may require leader.

 sure.

 also another object, may impoverished

 clearly.

 suspected notions freedom,
 resistance authority, good pretext
 destroying placing mercy enemy;
 reasons tyrant must always getting war.

 must.

 begins grow unpopular.

 necessary result.

 joined setting up, power,
 speak minds one another, courageous
 cast teeth done.

 yes, may expected.

 tyrant, means rule, must get rid them; cannot
 stop friend enemy good anything.

 cannot.

 therefore must look see valiant,
 high-minded, wise, wealthy; happy man, enemy
 all, must seek occasion whether no,
 made purgation state.

 yes, said, rare purgation.

 yes, said, sort purgation physicians make
 body; take away worse leave better part,
 reverse.

 rule, suppose cannot help himself.

 blessed alternative, said:--to compelled dwell
 many bad, hated, live all!

 yes, alternative.

 detestable actions citizens
 satellites greater devotion require?

 certainly.

 devoted band, procure them?

 flock him, said, accord, pays them.

 dog! said, drones, every sort every
 land.

 yes, said, are.

 desire get spot?

 mean?

 rob citizens slaves; set free
 enrol body-guard.

 sure, said; able trust best all.

 blessed creature, said, must tyrant be; put
 death others trusted friends.

 yes, said; quite sort.

 yes, said, new citizens called
 existence, admire companions, good hate
 avoid him.

 course.

 verily, then, tragedy wise thing euripides great tragedian.

 so?

 why, author pregnant saying,

 'tyrants wise living wise;'

 clearly meant say wise tyrant makes
 companions.

 yes, said, also praises tyranny godlike; many
 things kind said poets.

 therefore, said, tragic poets wise men forgive us
 others live manner receive
 state, eulogists tyranny.

 yes, said, wit doubtless forgive us.

 continue go cities attract mobs,
 hire voices fair loud persuasive, draw cities
 tyrannies democracies.

 true.

 moreover, paid receive honour--the greatest
 honour, might expected, tyrants, next greatest
 democracies; higher ascend constitution hill,
 reputation fails, seems unable shortness breath
 proceed further.

 true.

 wandering subject: let us therefore return
 enquire tyrant maintain fair numerous various
 ever-changing army his.

 if, said, sacred treasures city, confiscate
 spend them; far fortunes attainted persons may
 suffice, able diminish taxes would otherwise
 impose upon people.

 fail?

 why, clearly, said, boon companions, whether male
 female, maintained father's estate.

 mean say people, derived being,
 maintain companions?

 yes, said; cannot help themselves.

 people fly passion, aver grown-up son
 ought supported father, father
 supported son? father bring being, settle
 life, order son became man

 son undesirable associates.

 heaven, said, parent discover monster

 find weak son strong.

 why, mean say tyrant use violence? what!
 beat father opposes him?

 yes, will, first disarmed him.

 parricide, cruel guardian aged parent;
 real tyranny, longer mistake:
 saying is, people would escape smoke slavery
 freemen, fallen fire tyranny slaves. thus
 liberty, getting order reason, passes harshest
 bitterest form slavery.

 true, said.

 well; may rightly say sufficiently
 discussed nature tyranny, manner transition
 democracy tyranny?

 yes, quite enough, said.




 book ix.

 last comes tyrannical man;
 ask, formed democratical? live,
 happiness misery?

 yes, said, one remaining.

 is, however, said, previous question remains unanswered.

 question?

 think adequately determined nature number
 appetites, accomplished enquiry always
 confused.

 well, said, late supply omission.

 true, said; observe point want understand:
 certain unnecessary pleasures appetites conceive
 unlawful; every one appears them, persons
 controlled laws reason, better desires prevail
 them--either wholly banished become weak;
 case others stronger,
 them.

 appetites mean?

 mean awake reasoning human ruling
 power asleep; wild beast within us, gorged meat
 drink, starts shaken sleep, goes forth satisfy
 desires; conceivable folly crime--not excepting
 incest unnatural union, parricide, eating
 forbidden food--which time, parted company

 yes, said; view him, still.

 now, said, years passed away, must conceive

 yes, said, inevitably.

 must tyrannical man like tyrannical state,

 others?

 certainly.

 sure.

 comparing original city, king, city

 city, said, completely enslaved.

 yet, see, freemen well masters

 yes, said, see are--a few; people, speaking
 generally, best miserably degraded enslaved.

 man like state, said, must rule

 reflecting upon similar evils, held tyrannical state

 miserable?

 one speak.

 that?

 tyrannical nature, instead leading private life
 cursed misfortune public tyrant.

 said, gather right.

 yes, replied, high argument little
 certain, conjecture only; questions,
 respecting good evil greatest.

 true, said.

 let offer illustration, may, think, throw light
 upon subject.

 illustration?

 case rich individuals cities possess many slaves:
 may form idea tyrant's condition,
 slaves; difference slaves.

 yes, difference.

 know live securely nothing apprehend

 fear?

 nothing. observe reason this?

 yes; reason is, whole city leagued together
 protection individual.

 true, said. imagine one owners, master say
 fifty slaves, together family property slaves,
 carried god wilderness, freemen

 yes, said, utmost fear.

 time arrived compelled flatter divers
 slaves, make many promises freedom things, much

 yes, said, similitude exact.

 case utterly miserable? actual tyrant lead
 worse life whose life determined worst?

 certainly.

 real tyrant, whatever men may think, real slave,
 obliged practise greatest adulation servility,
 flatterer vilest mankind. desires
 utterly unable satisfy, wants one, truly
 poor, know inspect whole soul him: life
 long beset fear full convulsions distractions,
 even state resembles: surely resemblance holds?

 true, said.

 moreover, saying before, grows worse power:
 becomes necessity jealous, faithless, unjust,
 friendless, impious, first; purveyor
 cherisher every sort vice, consequence
 supremely miserable, makes everybody else miserable
 himself.

 man sense dispute words.

 come then, said, general umpire theatrical contests
 proclaims result, also decide opinion first
 scale happiness, second, order others
 follow: five all--they royal, timocratical,
 oligarchical, democratical, tyrannical.

 decision easily given, replied; shall choruses
 coming stage, must judge order
 enter, criterion virtue vice, happiness misery.

 need hire herald, shall announce, son ariston (the
 best) decided best justest also happiest,
 royal man king himself;
 worst unjust man also miserable,
 greatest tyrant also greatest
 tyrant state?

 make proclamation yourself, said.

 shall add, 'whether seen unseen gods men'?

 let words added.

 this, said, first proof; another,
 may also weight.

 that?

 second proof derived nature soul: seeing
 individual soul, like state, divided us three
 principles, division may, think, furnish new demonstration.

 nature?

 seems three principles three pleasures
 correspond; also three desires governing powers.

 mean? said.

 one principle which, saying, man learns,
 another angry; third, many forms,
 special name, denoted general term appetitive,
 extraordinary strength vehemence desires eating
 drinking sensual appetites main elements
 it; also money-loving, desires generally satisfied
 help money.

 true, said.

 say loves pleasures third part
 concerned gain, able fall back single
 notion; might truly intelligibly describe part soul
 loving gain money.

 agree you.

 again, passionate element wholly set ruling conquering
 getting fame?

 true.

 suppose call contentious ambitious--would term
 suitable?

 extremely suitable.

 hand, every one sees principle knowledge
 wholly directed truth, cares less either others
 gain fame.

 far less.

 'lover wisdom,' 'lover knowledge,' titles may fitly
 apply part soul?

 certainly.

 one principle prevails souls one class men, another
 others, may happen?

 yes.

 may begin assuming three classes
 men--lovers wisdom, lovers honour, lovers gain?

 exactly.

 three kinds pleasure, several objects?

 true.

 now, examine three classes men, ask turn
 lives pleasantest, found praising
 depreciating others: money-maker contrast
 vanity honour learning bring money solid
 advantages gold silver?

 true, said.

 lover honour--what opinion? think
 pleasure riches vulgar, pleasure learning,
 brings distinction, smoke nonsense him?

 true.

 suppose, said, philosopher sets value
 pleasures comparison pleasure knowing truth,
 pursuit abiding, ever learning, far indeed
 heaven pleasure? call pleasures necessary,
 idea necessity them, would rather
 them?

 doubt that, replied.

 since, then, pleasures class life
 dispute, question life less honourable,
 better worse, pleasant painless--how
 shall know speaks truly?

 cannot tell, said.

 well, ought criterion? better experience
 wisdom reason?

 cannot better, said.

 then, said, reflect. three individuals, greatest
 experience pleasures enumerated? lover
 gain, learning nature essential truth, greater experience
 pleasure knowledge philosopher pleasure
 gain?

 philosopher, replied, greatly advantage;
 necessity always known taste pleasures
 childhood upwards: lover gain experience
 necessity tasted--or, rather say, even desired, could
 hardly tasted--the sweetness learning knowing truth.

 lover wisdom great advantage lover gain,
 double experience?

 yes, great.

 again, greater experience pleasures honour,
 lover honour pleasures wisdom?

 nay, said, three honoured proportion attain
 object; rich man brave man wise man alike
 crowd admirers, receive honour
 experience pleasures honour; delight
 found knowledge true known philosopher only.

 experience, then, enable judge better one?

 far better.

 one wisdom well experience?

 certainly.

 further, faculty instrument judgment
 possessed covetous ambitious man, philosopher?

 faculty?

 reason, whom, saying, decision ought rest.

 yes.

 reasoning peculiarly instrument?

 certainly.

 wealth gain criterion, praise blame
 lover gain would surely trustworthy?

 assuredly.

 honour victory courage, case judgment
 ambitious pugnacious would truest?

 clearly.

 since experience wisdom reason judges--

 inference possible, replied, pleasures
 approved lover wisdom reason truest.

 arrive result, pleasure intelligent
 part soul pleasantest three, us
 ruling principle pleasantest life.

 unquestionably, said, wise man speaks authority
 approves life.

 judge affirm life next,
 pleasure next?

 clearly soldier lover honour; nearer
 money-maker.

 last comes lover gain?

 true, said.

 twice succession, then, man overthrown unjust
 conflict; comes third trial, dedicated
 olympian zeus saviour: sage whispers ear pleasure
 except wise quite true pure--all others shadow
 only; surely prove greatest decisive
 falls?

 yes, greatest; explain yourself?

 work subject shall answer questions.

 proceed.

 say, then, pleasure opposed pain?

 true.

 neutral state neither pleasure pain?

 is.

 state intermediate, sort repose soul
 either--that mean?

 yes.

 remember people say sick?

 say?

 nothing pleasanter health. never
 knew greatest pleasures ill.

 yes, know, said.

 persons suffering acute pain, must heard
 say nothing pleasanter get rid pain?

 have.

 many cases suffering mere rest
 cessation pain, positive enjoyment, extolled
 greatest pleasure?

 yes, said; time pleased well content
 rest.

 again, pleasure ceases, sort rest cessation
 painful?

 doubtless, said.

 intermediate state rest pleasure also
 pain?

 would seem.

 neither become both?

 say not.

 pleasure pain motions soul, not?

 yes.

 neither shown rest motion,
 mean them?

 yes.

 how, then, right supposing absence pain
 pleasure, absence pleasure pain?

 impossible.

 appearance reality; say,
 rest pleasure moment comparison painful,
 painful comparison pleasant;
 representations, tried test true pleasure, real
 sort imposition?

 inference.

 look class pleasures antecedent pains
 longer suppose, perhaps may present, pleasure
 cessation pain, pain pleasure.

 they, said, shall find them?

 many them: take example pleasures smell,
 great antecedent pains; come moment,
 depart leave pain behind them.

 true, said.

 let us not, then, induced believe pure pleasure
 cessation pain, pain pleasure.

 no.

 still, numerous violent pleasures reach soul
 body generally sort--they reliefs pain.

 true.

 anticipations future pleasures pains like
 nature?

 yes.

 shall give illustration them?

 let hear.

 would allow, said, nature upper lower
 middle region?

 should.

 person go lower middle region, would
 imagine going up; standing middle
 sees whence come, would imagine already
 upper region, never seen true upper world?

 sure, said; think otherwise?

 taken back would imagine, truly imagine,
 descending?

 doubt.

 would arise ignorance true upper middle
 lower regions?

 yes.

 wonder persons inexperienced truth,
 wrong ideas many things, also wrong
 ideas pleasure pain intermediate state;
 drawn towards painful feel pain think
 pain experience real, like manner,
 drawn away pain neutral intermediate state, firmly
 believe reached goal satiety pleasure; they,
 knowing pleasure, err contrasting pain absence pain,
 like contrasting black grey instead white--can
 wonder, say, this?

 no, indeed; much disposed wonder opposite.

 look matter thus:--hunger, thirst, like, inanitions
 bodily state?

 yes.

 ignorance folly inanitions soul?

 true.

 food wisdom corresponding satisfactions either?

 certainly.

 satisfaction derived less
 existence truer?

 clearly, more.

 classes things greater share pure existence
 judgment--those food drink condiments kinds
 sustenance examples, class contains true opinion
 knowledge mind different kinds virtue? put
 question way:--which pure being--that
 concerned invariable, immortal, true,
 nature, found natures; concerned
 found variable mortal, variable
 mortal?

 far purer, replied, concerned
 invariable.

 essence invariable partake knowledge
 degree essence?

 yes, knowledge degree.

 truth degree?

 yes.

 and, conversely, less truth also less
 essence?

 necessarily.

 then, general, kinds things service
 body less truth essence service
 soul?

 far less.

 body less truth essence soul?

 yes.

 filled real existence, actually real
 existence, really filled filled less
 real existence less real?

 course.

 pleasure filled according
 nature, really filled real
 really truly enjoy true pleasure; whereas
 participates less real less truly surely satisfied,
 participate illusory less real pleasure?

 unquestionably.

 know wisdom virtue, always busy
 gluttony sensuality, go far mean;
 region move random throughout life, never pass
 true upper world; thither neither look, ever
 find way, neither truly filled true being,
 taste pure abiding pleasure. like cattle, eyes
 always looking heads stooping earth, is,
 dining-table, fatten feed breed, and,
 excessive love delights, kick butt one another
 horns hoofs made iron; kill one another
 reason insatiable lust. fill
 substantial, part fill
 also unsubstantial incontinent.

 verily, socrates, said glaucon, describe life many like
 oracle.

 pleasures mixed pains--how otherwise?
 mere shadows pictures true, coloured
 contrast, exaggerates light shade, implant
 minds fools insane desires themselves; fought
 stesichorus says greeks fought shadow
 helen troy ignorance truth.

 something sort must inevitably happen.

 must like happen spirited passionate element
 soul? passionate man carries passion
 action, like case, whether envious ambitious,
 violent contentious, angry discontented, seeking
 attain honour victory satisfaction anger without
 reason sense?

 yes, said, happen spirited element also.

 may confidently assert lovers money honour,
 seek pleasures guidance company
 reason knowledge, pursue win pleasures
 wisdom shows them, also truest pleasures highest
 degree attainable them, inasmuch follow truth;
 pleasures natural them,
 best one also natural him?

 yes, certainly; best natural.

 whole soul follows philosophical principle,
 division, several parts just,
 business, enjoy severally best truest pleasures
 capable?

 exactly.

 either two principles prevails, fails
 attaining pleasure, compels rest pursue
 pleasure shadow own?

 true.

 greater interval separates philosophy
 reason, strange illusive pleasure?

 yes.

 farthest reason greatest distance
 law order?

 clearly.

 lustful tyrannical desires are, saw, greatest
 distance? yes.

 royal orderly desires nearest?

 yes.

 tyrant live greatest distance true natural
 pleasure, king least?

 certainly.

 so, tyrant live unpleasantly, king
 pleasantly?

 inevitably.

 would know measure interval separates them?

 tell me?

 appear three pleasures, one genuine two spurious:
 transgression tyrant reaches point beyond spurious;
 run away region law reason, taken abode
 certain slave pleasures satellites, measure
 inferiority expressed figure.

 mean?

 assume, said, tyrant third place
 oligarch; democrat middle?

 yes.

 truth preceded, wedded
 image pleasure thrice removed truth pleasure
 oligarch?

 will.

 oligarch third royal; since count one royal
 aristocratical?

 yes, third.

 tyrant removed true pleasure space number
 three times three?

 manifestly.

 shadow tyrannical pleasure determined number
 length plane figure.

 certainly.

 raise power make plane solid,
 difficulty seeing vast interval tyrant
 parted king.

 yes; arithmetician easily sum.

 person begins end measures interval
 king parted tyrant truth pleasure,
 find him, multiplication completed, living 729 times
 pleasantly, tyrant painfully interval.

 wonderful calculation! enormous distance
 separates unjust regard pleasure pain!

 yet true calculation, said, number nearly concerns human
 life, human beings concerned days nights months
 years. (729 nearly equals number days nights year.)

 yes, said, human life certainly concerned them.

 good man thus superior pleasure evil
 unjust, superiority infinitely greater propriety
 life beauty virtue?

 immeasurably greater.

 well, said, arrived stage argument,
 may revert words brought us hither: one saying
 injustice gain perfectly unjust reputed
 just?

 yes, said.

 then, determined power quality justice
 injustice, let us little conversation him.

 shall say him?

 let us make image soul, may words
 presented eyes.

 sort?

 ideal image soul, like composite creations ancient
 mythology, chimera scylla cerberus, many
 others two different natures said grow one.

 said unions.

 model form multitudinous, many-headed monster,
 ring heads manner beasts, tame wild,
 able generate metamorphose will.

 suppose marvellous powers artist; but, language
 pliable wax similar substance, let model
 propose.

 suppose make second form lion, third
 man, second smaller first, third smaller
 second.

 that, said, easier task; made say.

 join them, let three grow one.

 accomplished.

 next fashion outside single image, man,
 able look within, sees outer hull,
 may believe beast single human creature.

 done so, said.

 now, maintains profitable human
 creature unjust, unprofitable just, let us reply
 that, right, profitable creature feast
 multitudinous monster strengthen lion lion-like
 qualities, starve weaken man, consequently liable
 dragged mercy either two;
 attempt familiarize harmonize one another--he
 ought rather suffer fight bite devour one another.

 certainly, said; approver injustice says.

 supporter justice makes answer ever
 speak act give man within way
 complete mastery entire human creature. watch
 many-headed monster like good husbandman, fostering
 cultivating gentle qualities, preventing wild ones
 growing; making lion-heart ally, common care
 uniting several parts one another
 himself.

 yes, said, quite maintainer justice say.

 every point view, whether pleasure, honour,
 advantage, approver justice right speaks truth,
 disapprover wrong false ignorant?

 yes, every point view.

 come, now, let us gently reason unjust,
 intentionally error. 'sweet sir,' say him, 'what think
 things esteemed noble ignoble? noble
 subjects beast man, rather god man;
 ignoble subjects man beast?' hardly avoid
 saying yes--can now?

 regard opinion.

 but, agree far, may ask answer another question:
 'then would man profit received gold silver
 condition enslave noblest part worst?
 imagine man sold son daughter slavery
 money, especially sold hands fierce evil men,
 would gainer, however large might sum
 received? one say miserable caitiff
 remorselessly sells divine godless
 detestable? eriphyle took necklace price husband's
 life, taking bribe order compass worse ruin.'

 yes, said glaucon, far worse--i answer him.

 intemperate censured old, huge
 multiform monster allowed much large?

 clearly.

 men blamed pride bad temper lion serpent
 element disproportionately grows gains strength?

 yes.

 luxury softness blamed, relax weaken
 creature, make coward him?

 true.

 man reproached flattery meanness subordinates
 spirited animal unruly monster, and, sake money,
 never enough, habituates days
 youth trampled mire, lion become
 monkey?

 true, said.

 mean employments manual arts reproach?
 imply natural weakness higher principle; individual
 unable control creatures within him, court them,
 great study flatter them.

 appears reason.

 therefore, desirous placing rule like
 best, say ought servant best,
 divine rules; not, thrasymachus supposed, injury
 servant, every one better ruled divine wisdom
 dwelling within him; or, impossible, external
 authority, order may all, far possible,
 government, friends equals.

 true, said.

 clearly seen intention law,
 ally whole city; seen also authority
 exercise children, refusal let free
 established principle analogous constitution
 state, cultivation higher element set
 hearts guardian ruler like own, done may
 go ways.

 yes, said, purpose law manifest.

 point view, then, ground say man
 profited injustice intemperance baseness,
 make worse man, even though acquire money power
 wickedness?

 point view all.

 shall profit, injustice undetected unpunished?
 undetected gets worse, whereas detected
 punished brutal part nature silenced humanized;
 gentler element liberated, whole soul perfected
 ennobled acquirement justice temperance wisdom,
 body ever receiving gifts beauty, strength health,
 proportion soul honourable body.

 certainly, said.

 nobler purpose man understanding devote energies

 clearly, said.

 next place, regulate bodily habit training,

 book x.

 many excellences perceive order state,
 none upon reflection pleases better rule
 poetry.

 refer?

 rejection imitative poetry, certainly ought
 received; see far clearly parts soul
 distinguished.

 mean?

 speaking confidence, like words repeated
 tragedians rest imitative tribe--but
 mind saying you, poetical imitations ruinous
 understanding hearers, knowledge true
 nature antidote them.

 explain purport remark.

 well, tell you, although always earliest youth
 awe love homer, even makes words falter
 lips, great captain teacher whole
 charming tragic company; man reverenced
 truth, therefore speak out.

 good, said.

 listen then, rather, answer me.

 put question.

 tell imitation is? really know.

 likely thing, then, know.

 not? duller eye may often see thing sooner
 keener.

 true, said; presence, even faint
 notion, could muster courage utter it. enquire
 yourself?

 well then, shall begin enquiry usual manner: whenever
 number individuals common name, assume also
 corresponding idea form:--do understand me?

 do.

 let us take common instance; beds tables
 world--plenty them, not?

 yes.

 two ideas forms them--one idea bed,
 table.

 true.

 maker either makes bed makes table
 use, accordance idea--that way speaking
 similar instances--but artificer makes ideas themselves:
 could he?

 impossible.

 another artist,--i like know would say
 him.

 he?

 one maker works workmen.

 extraordinary man!

 wait little, reason saying so.
 able make vessels every kind,
 plants animals, things--the earth heaven,
 things heaven earth; makes gods
 also.

 must wizard mistake.

 oh! incredulous, you? mean
 maker creator, one sense might maker
 things another not? see way
 could make yourself?

 way?

 easy way enough; rather, many ways feat
 might quickly easily accomplished, none quicker
 turning mirror round round--you would soon enough make sun
 heavens, earth yourself, animals plants,
 things speaking,
 mirror.

 yes, said; would appearances only.

 good, said, coming point now. painter
 is, conceive, another--a creator appearances,
 not?

 course.

 suppose say creates untrue. yet
 sense painter also creates bed?

 yes, said, real bed.

 maker bed? saying makes,
 idea which, according view, essence bed,
 particular bed?

 yes, did.

 make exists cannot make true
 existence, semblance existence; one
 say work maker bed, workman,
 real existence, could hardly supposed speaking truth.

 rate, replied, philosophers would say speaking
 truth.

 wonder, then, work indistinct expression truth.

 wonder.

 suppose light examples offered enquire
 imitator is?

 please.

 well then, three beds: one existing nature, made
 god, think may say--for one else maker?

 no.

 another work carpenter?

 yes.

 work painter third?

 yes.

 beds, then, three kinds, three artists
 superintend them: god, maker bed, painter?

 yes, three them.

 god, whether choice necessity, made one bed nature
 one only; two ideal beds neither ever ever
 made god.

 that?

 even made two, third would still appear behind
 would idea, would
 ideal bed two others.

 true, said.

 god knew this, desired real maker real bed,
 particular maker particular bed, therefore created bed
 essentially nature one only.

 believe.

 shall we, then, speak natural author maker bed?

 yes, replied; inasmuch natural process creation
 author things.

 shall say carpenter--is also maker
 bed?

 yes.

 would call painter creator maker?

 certainly not.

 yet maker, relation bed?

 think, said, may fairly designate imitator
 others make.

 good, said; call third descent nature
 imitator?

 certainly, said.

 tragic poet imitator, therefore, like
 imitators, thrice removed king truth?

 appears so.

 imitator agreed. painter?--i
 would like know whether may thought imitate
 originally exists nature, creations artists?

 latter.

 appear? still determine this.

 mean?

 mean, may look bed different points view,
 obliquely directly point view, bed
 appear different, difference reality.
 things.

 yes, said, difference apparent.

 let ask another question: art painting
 designed be--an imitation things are,
 appear--of appearance reality?

 appearance.

 imitator, said, long way truth,
 things lightly touches small part them, part
 image. example: painter paint cobbler, carpenter,
 artist, though knows nothing arts; and,
 good artist, may deceive children simple persons, shows
 picture carpenter distance, fancy
 looking real carpenter.

 certainly.

 whenever one informs us found man knows
 arts, things else anybody knows, every single thing
 higher degree accuracy man--whoever tells us
 this, think imagine simple creature
 likely deceived wizard actor met,
 thought all-knowing, unable analyse
 nature knowledge ignorance imitation.

 true.

 so, hear persons saying tragedians, homer,
 head, know arts things human, virtue well
 vice, divine things too, good poet cannot compose
 well unless knows subject, knowledge
 never poet, ought consider whether also may
 similar illusion. perhaps may come across imitators
 deceived them; may remembered saw
 works imitations thrice removed
 truth, could easily made without knowledge truth,
 appearances realities? or, all,
 may right, poets really know things
 seem many speak well?

 question, said, means considered.

 suppose person able make original
 well image, would seriously devote image-making
 branch? would allow imitation ruling principle life,
 nothing higher him?

 say not.

 real artist, knew imitating, would interested
 realities imitations; would desire leave memorials
 works many fair; and, instead author
 encomiums, would prefer theme them.

 yes, said, would source much greater honour
 profit.

 then, said, must put question homer; medicine,
 arts poems incidentally refer:
 going ask him, poet, whether cured patients
 like asclepius, left behind school medicine
 asclepiads were, whether talks medicine arts
 second-hand; right know respecting military tactics,
 politics, education, chiefest noblest subjects
 poems, may fairly ask them. 'friend homer,' say
 him, 'if second remove truth say
 virtue, third--not image maker imitator--and
 able discern pursuits make men better worse
 private public life, tell us state ever better governed
 help? good order lacedaemon due lycurgus, many
 cities great small similarly benefited others;
 says good legislator done
 good? italy sicily boast charondas, solon
 renowned among us; city anything say you?'
 city might name?

 think not, said glaucon; even homerids pretend
 legislator.

 well, war record carried successfully
 him, aided counsels, alive?

 not.

 invention his, applicable arts human
 life, thales milesian anacharsis scythian,
 ingenious men conceived, attributed him?

 absolutely nothing kind.

 but, homer never public service, privately guide
 teacher any? lifetime friends loved associate
 him, handed posterity homeric way life,
 established pythagoras greatly beloved
 wisdom, whose followers day quite celebrated
 order named him?

 nothing kind recorded him. surely, socrates,
 creophylus, companion homer, child flesh, whose name
 always makes us laugh, might justly ridiculed stupidity,
 if, said, homer greatly neglected others
 day alive?

 yes, replied, tradition. imagine, glaucon,
 homer really able educate improve mankind--if
 possessed knowledge mere imitator--can imagine,
 say, would many followers, honoured
 loved them? protagoras abdera, prodicus ceos, host
 others, whisper contemporaries: 'you never
 able manage either house state appoint
 us ministers education'--and ingenious device
 effect making men love companions
 carry shoulders. conceivable
 contemporaries homer, hesiod, would allowed
 either go rhapsodists, really able
 make mankind virtuous? would unwilling part
 gold, compelled stay home
 them? or, master would stay, disciples would
 followed everywhere, got education enough?

 yes, socrates, that, think, quite true.

 must infer poetical individuals, beginning
 homer, imitators; copy images virtue like,
 truth never reach? poet like painter who,
 already observed, make likeness cobbler though
 understands nothing cobbling; picture good enough
 know does, judge colours
 figures.

 quite so.

 like manner poet words phrases may said lay
 colours several arts, understanding nature
 enough imitate them; people, ignorant is,
 judge words, imagine speaks cobbling,
 military tactics, anything else, metre harmony
 rhythm, speaks well--such sweet influence melody
 rhythm nature have. think must observed
 poor appearance tales poets make stripped
 colours music puts upon them, recited simple prose.

 yes, said.

 like faces never really beautiful,
 blooming; bloom youth passed away them?

 exactly.

 another point: imitator maker image knows nothing
 true existence; knows appearances only. right?

 yes.

 let us clear understanding, satisfied half
 explanation.

 proceed.

 painter say paint reins, paint bit?

 yes.

 worker leather brass make them?

 certainly.

 painter know right form bit reins? nay,
 hardly even workers brass leather make them;
 horseman knows use them--he knows right form.

 true.

 may say things?

 what?

 three arts concerned things: one
 uses, another makes, third imitates them?

 yes.

 excellence beauty truth every structure, animate
 inanimate, every action man, relative use
 nature artist intended them.

 true.

 user must greatest experience them,
 must indicate maker good bad qualities develop
 use; example, flute-player tell
 flute-maker flutes satisfactory performer;
 tell ought make them, attend
 instructions?

 course.

 one knows therefore speaks authority goodness
 badness flutes, other, confiding him,
 told him?

 true.

 instrument same, excellence badness
 maker attain correct belief; gain
 knows, talking compelled hear
 say, whereas user knowledge?

 true.

 imitator either? know use whether
 drawing correct beautiful? right opinion
 compelled associate another knows gives
 instructions draw?

 neither.

 true opinion knowledge
 goodness badness imitations?

 suppose not.

 imitative artist brilliant state intelligence
 creations?

 nay, much reverse.

 still go imitating without knowing makes thing
 good bad, may expected therefore imitate
 appears good ignorant multitude?

 so.

 thus far pretty well agreed imitator
 knowledge worth mentioning imitates. imitation kind
 play sport, tragic poets, whether write iambic
 heroic verse, imitators highest degree?

 true.

 tell me, conjure you, imitation shown us
 concerned thrice removed truth?

 certainly.

 faculty man imitation addressed?

 mean?

 explain: body large seen near, appears small
 seen distance?

 true.

 object appears straight looked water,
 crooked water; concave becomes convex, owing
 illusion colours sight liable. thus every sort
 confusion revealed within us; weakness
 human mind art conjuring deceiving light
 shadow ingenious devices imposes, effect upon us
 like magic.

 true.

 arts measuring numbering weighing come
 rescue human understanding--there beauty them--and
 apparent greater less, heavier, longer mastery
 us, give way calculation measure weight?

 true.

 this, surely, must work calculating rational
 principle soul?

 sure.

 principle measures certifies things

 apparent contradiction?

 true.

 saying contradiction impossible--the
 faculty cannot contrary opinions time

 true.

 exactly.

 imitative art inferior marries inferior,

 true.

 confined sight only, extend hearing

 probably would true poetry.

 rely, said, probability derived analogy

 may state question thus:--imitation imitates actions men,
 whether voluntary involuntary, which, imagine, good

 no, nothing else.

 thousand similar oppositions occurring moment?

 right, said.

 yes, said, thus far right; omission
 must supplied.

 omission?

 saying good man, misfortune lose
 son anything else dear him, bear loss
 equanimity another?

 yes.

 sorrow, shall say although cannot help
 sorrowing, moderate sorrow?

 latter, said, truer statement.

 tell me: likely struggle hold
 sorrow seen equals, alone?

 make great difference whether seen not.

 mind saying many things
 would ashamed one hearing seeing do?

 true.

 principle law reason bids resist,
 well feeling misfortune forcing indulge
 sorrow?

 true.

 man drawn two opposite directions,
 object, this, affirm, necessarily implies two distinct principles
 him?

 certainly.

 one ready follow guidance law?

 mean?

 law would say patient suffering best,
 give way impatience, knowing whether
 things good evil; nothing gained impatience; also,
 human thing serious importance, grief stands
 way moment required.

 required? asked.

 take counsel happened, dice
 thrown order affairs way reason deems best;
 not, like children fall, keeping hold part struck
 wasting time setting howl, always accustoming soul
 forthwith apply remedy, raising sickly fallen,
 banishing cry sorrow healing art.

 yes, said, true way meeting attacks fortune.

 yes, said; higher principle ready follow suggestion
 reason?

 clearly.

 principle, inclines us recollection
 troubles lamentation, never enough them, may
 call irrational, useless, cowardly?

 indeed, may.

 latter--i mean rebellious principle--furnish
 great variety materials imitation? whereas wise calm
 temperament, always nearly equable, easy imitate
 appreciate imitated, especially public festival
 promiscuous crowd assembled theatre. feeling represented
 one strangers.

 certainly.

 imitative poet aims popular nature made,
 art intended, please affect rational principle
 soul; prefer passionate fitful temper,
 easily imitated?

 clearly.

 may fairly take place side painter,
 like two ways: first, inasmuch creations
 inferior degree truth--in this, say, like him;
 also like concerned inferior part soul;
 therefore shall right refusing admit well-ordered
 state, awakens nourishes strengthens feelings
 impairs reason. city evil permitted
 authority good put way, soul man,

 indulges irrational nature discernment greater
 less, thinks thing one time great another
 small--he manufacturer images far removed

 harmed), surely awful thing?

 yes, certainly, effect say.

 hear judge: best us, conceive, listen
 passage homer, one tragedians, represents
 pitiful hero drawling sorrows long oration,
 weeping, smiting breast--the best us, know, delight

 yes, course know.

 sorrow happens us, may observe

 no, said, certainly reasonable.

 nay, said, quite reasonable one point view.

 quite true, said.

 true, said.

 since reverted subject poetry, let
 defence serve show reasonableness former judgment
 sending away state art tendencies
 described; reason constrained us. may impute us
 harshness want politeness, let us tell
 ancient quarrel philosophy poetry; many
 proofs, saying 'the yelping hound howling lord,'
 one 'mighty vain talk fools,' 'the mob sages
 circumventing zeus,' 'subtle thinkers beggars
 all'; innumerable signs ancient enmity
 them. notwithstanding this, let us assure sweet friend
 sister arts imitation, prove title exist
 well-ordered state shall delighted receive her--we
 conscious charms; may account betray
 truth. dare say, glaucon, much charmed am,
 especially appears homer?

 yes, indeed, greatly charmed.

 shall propose, then, allowed return exile,

 certainly.

 may grant defenders lovers
 poetry yet poets permission speak prose behalf:
 let show pleasant also useful states
 human life, listen kindly spirit;

 poetry well delight?

 certainly, said, shall gainers.

 defence fails, then, dear friend, like persons
 enamoured something, put restraint upon

 yes, said, quite agree you.

 yes, said, dear glaucon, great issue stake, greater
 appears, whether man good bad. one

 yes, said; convinced argument, believe
 one else would been.

 yet mention made greatest prizes rewards

 what, greater still? are, must
 inconceivable greatness.

 why, said, ever great short time? whole period
 three score years ten surely little thing comparison

 say rather 'nothing,' replied.

 immortal seriously think little space rather

 whole, certainly. ask?

 looked astonishment, said: no, heaven:
 really prepared maintain this?

 yes, said, ought be, too--there difficulty
 proving it.

 see great difficulty; like hear state
 argument make light.

 listen then.

 attending.

 thing call good another call evil?

 yes, replied.

 would agree thinking corrupting destroying
 element evil, saving improving element good?

 yes.

 admit every thing good also evil;
 ophthalmia evil eyes disease whole body;
 mildew corn, rot timber, rust copper iron:
 everything, almost everything, inherent evil
 disease?

 yes, said.

 anything infected evils made evil,
 last wholly dissolves dies?

 true.

 vice evil inherent destruction each;
 destroy nothing else will;
 good certainly destroy them, again, neither
 good evil.

 certainly not.

 if, then, find nature inherent corruption
 cannot dissolved destroyed, may certain
 nature destruction?

 may assumed.

 well, said, evil corrupts soul?

 yes, said, evils passing
 review: unrighteousness, intemperance, cowardice, ignorance.

 dissolve destroy her?--and let us
 fall error supposing unjust foolish man,
 detected, perishes injustice, evil
 soul. take analogy body: evil body
 disease wastes reduces annihilates body;
 things speaking come annihilation
 corruption attaching inhering
 destroying them. true?

 yes.

 consider soul like manner. injustice evil
 exists soul waste consume her? attaching
 soul inhering last bring death, separate
 body?

 certainly not.

 yet, said, unreasonable suppose anything perish
 without affection external evil could
 destroyed within corruption own?

 is, replied.

 consider, said, glaucon, even badness food, whether
 staleness, decomposition, bad quality, confined
 actual food, supposed destroy body; although,
 badness food communicates corruption body, say
 body destroyed corruption itself,
 disease, brought this; body, one thing,
 destroyed badness food, another,
 engender natural infection--this shall absolutely deny?

 true.

 and, principle, unless bodily evil produce evil
 soul, must suppose soul, one thing,
 dissolved merely external evil belongs another?

 yes, said, reason that.

 either, then, let us refute conclusion, or, remains
 unrefuted, let us never say fever, disease,
 knife put throat, even cutting whole body
 minutest pieces, destroy soul, proved
 become unholy unrighteous consequence things
 done body; soul, anything else
 destroyed internal evil, destroyed external one,
 affirmed man.

 surely, replied, one ever prove souls men
 become unjust consequence death.

 one would rather admit immortality soul
 boldly denies this, says dying really become
 evil unrighteous, then, speaker right, suppose
 injustice, like disease, must assumed fatal unjust,
 take disorder die natural inherent power
 destruction evil has, kills sooner later,
 quite another way which, present, wicked receive
 death hands others penalty deeds?

 nay, said, case injustice, fatal unjust,
 terrible him, delivered evil.
 rather suspect opposite truth, injustice which,
 power, murder others, keeps murderer alive--aye,
 well awake too; far removed dwelling-place
 house death.

 true, said; inherent natural vice evil soul unable
 kill destroy her, hardly appointed
 destruction body, destroy soul anything else except
 appointed destruction.

 yes, hardly be.

 soul cannot destroyed evil, whether inherent
 external, must exist ever, existing ever, must
 immortal?

 certainly.

 conclusion, said; and, true conclusion,
 souls must always same, none destroyed
 diminish number. neither increase, increase
 immortal natures must come something mortal, things would
 thus end immortality.

 true.

 cannot believe--reason allow us--any
 believe soul, truest nature, full variety
 difference dissimilarity.

 mean? said.

 soul, said, being, proven, immortal, must fairest
 compositions cannot compounded many elements?

 certainly not.

 immortality demonstrated previous argument,
 many proofs; see really is, behold
 her, marred communion body miseries, must
 contemplate eye reason, original purity;
 beauty revealed, justice injustice
 things described manifested clearly. thus
 far, spoken truth concerning appears present,
 must remember also seen condition
 may compared sea-god glaucus, whose original
 image hardly discerned natural members broken
 crushed damaged waves sorts ways,
 incrustations grown seaweed shells stones,
 like monster natural form.
 soul behold similar condition, disfigured
 ten thousand ills. there, glaucon, must look.

 then?

 love wisdom. let us see affects, society
 converse seeks virtue near kindred immortal
 eternal divine; also different would become wholly
 following superior principle, borne divine impulse
 ocean is, disengaged stones shells
 things earth rock wild variety spring around
 feeds upon earth, overgrown good things
 life termed: would see is, know
 whether one shape many, nature is.
 affections forms takes present life think
 said enough.

 true, replied.

 thus, said, fulfilled conditions argument;
 introduced rewards glories justice, which,
 saying, found homer hesiod; justice
 nature shown best soul nature. let
 man just, whether ring gyges not, even
 addition ring gyges put helmet hades.

 true.

 now, glaucon, harm enumerating
 many great rewards justice virtues
 procure soul gods men, life death.

 certainly not, said.

 repay me, then, borrowed argument?

 borrow?

 assumption man appear unjust unjust
 just: opinion even true state case
 could possibly escape eyes gods men, still admission
 ought made sake argument, order pure
 justice might weighed pure injustice. remember?

 much blame forgotten.

 then, cause decided, demand behalf justice

 granted.

 true.

 certainly.

 must notion man, even

 yes, said; like god surely neglected him.

 unjust may opposite supposed?

 certainly.

 such, then, palms victory gods give just?

 certainly, said, say true.

 these, then, prizes rewards gifts bestowed

 yes, said; fair lasting.

 yet, said, nothing either number greatness
