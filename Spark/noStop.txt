leaves long, grass green,
hemlock-umbels tall fair,
glade light seen
stars shadow shimmering.
tinuviel dancing
music pipe unseen,
light stars hair,
raiment glimmering.
beren came mountains cold,
lost wandered leaves,
elven-river rolled.
walked along sorrowing.
peered hemlock-leaves
saw wonder flowers gold
upon mantle sleeves,
hair like shadow following.
enchantment healed weary feet
hills doomed roam;
forth hastened, strong fleet,
grasped moonbeams glistening.
woven woods elvenhome
lightly fled dancing feet,
left lonely still roam
silent forest listening.
heard oft flying sound
feet light linden-leaves,
music welling underground,
hidden hollows quavering.
withered lay hemlock-sheaves,
one one sighing sound
whispering fell beechen leaves
wintry woodland wavering.
sought ever, wandering far
leaves years thickly strewn,
light moon ray star
frosty heavens shivering.
mantle glinted moon,
hill-top high far
danced, feet strewn
mist silver quivering.
winter passed, came again,
song released sudden spring,
like rising lark, falling rain,
melting water bubbling.
saw elven-flowers spring
feet, healed
longed dance sing
upon grass untroubling.
fled, swift came.
tinuviel! tinuviel!
called elvish name;
halted listening.
one moment stood she, spell
voice laid her: beren came,
doom fell tinuviel
arms lay glistening.
beren looked eyes
within shadows hair,
trembling starlight skies
saw mirrored shimmering.
tinuviel elven-fair,
immortal maiden elven-wise,
cast shadowy hair
arms like silver glimmering.
long way fate bore,
o'er stony mountains cold grey,
halls iron darkling door,
woods nightshade morrowless.
sundering seas lay,
yet last met more,
long ago passed away
forest singing sorrowless.
