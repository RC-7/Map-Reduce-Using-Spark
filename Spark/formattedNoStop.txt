ii. mail 149
dover road lay, friday night late november, 150
first persons history business. 151
dover road lay, him, beyond dover mail, lumbered 152
shooter's hill. walked hill mire side mail, 153
rest passengers did; least relish 154
walking exercise, circumstances, hill, 155
harness, mud, mail, heavy, 156
horses three times already come stop, besides drawing 157
coach across road, mutinous intent taking back 158
blackheath. reins whip coachman guard, however, 159
combination, read article war forbade purpose 160
otherwise strongly favour argument, brute animals 161
endued reason; team capitulated returned 162
duty. 163
drooping heads tremulous tails, mashed way 164
thick mud, floundering stumbling whiles, 165
falling pieces larger joints. often driver rested 166
brought stand, wary "wo-ho! so-ho-then!" 167
near leader violently shook head everything upon it--like 168
unusually emphatic horse, denying coach could got 169
hill. whenever leader made rattle, passenger started, 170
nervous passenger might, disturbed mind. 171
steaming mist hollows, roamed 172
forlornness hill, like evil spirit, seeking rest finding 173
none. clammy intensely cold mist, made slow way 174
air ripples visibly followed overspread one another, 175
waves unwholesome sea might do. dense enough shut 176
everything light coach-lamps workings, 177
yards road; reek labouring horses steamed 178
it, made all. 179
two passengers, besides one, plodding hill 180
side mail. three wrapped cheekbones 181
ears, wore jack-boots. one three could said, 182
anything saw, either two like; 183
hidden almost many wrappers eyes mind, 184
eyes body, two companions. days, travellers 185

road might robber league robbers. latter, 187
every posting-house ale-house could produce somebody 188
"the captain's" pay, ranging landlord lowest stable 189
non-descript, likeliest thing upon cards. guard 190
dover mail thought himself, friday night november, one 191
thousand seven hundred seventy-five, lumbering shooter's hill, 192
stood particular perch behind mail, beating feet, 193
keeping eye hand arm-chest him, 194
loaded blunderbuss lay top six eight loaded horse-pistols, 195
deposited substratum cutlass. 196
dover mail usual genial position guard suspected 197
passengers, passengers suspected one another guard, 198
suspected everybody else, coachman sure nothing 199
horses; cattle could clear conscience 200
taken oath two testaments fit 201
journey. 202
"wo-ho!" said coachman. "so, then! one pull 203
top damned you, trouble enough get 204
it!--joe!" 205
"halloa!" guard replied. 206
"what o'clock make it, joe?" 207
"ten minutes, good, past eleven." 208
"my blood!" ejaculated vexed coachman, "and atop shooter's 209
yet! tst! yah! get you!" 210
emphatic horse, cut short whip decided negative, 211
made decided scramble it, three horses followed 212
suit. more, dover mail struggled on, jack-boots 213
passengers squashing along side. stopped coach 214
stopped, kept close company it. one three 215
hardihood propose another walk little ahead 216
mist darkness, would put fair way 217
getting shot instantly highwayman. 218
last burst carried mail summit hill. horses 219
stopped breathe again, guard got skid wheel 220
descent, open coach-door let passengers in. 221
"tst! joe!" cried coachman warning voice, looking 222
box. 223
"what say, tom?" 224
listened. 225
"i say horse canter coming up, joe." 226
"_i_ say horse gallop, tom," returned guard, leaving hold 227
door, mounting nimbly place. "gentlemen! king's 228
name, you!" 229
hurried adjuration, cocked blunderbuss, stood 230
offensive. 231
passenger booked history, coach-step, getting in; 232
two passengers close behind him, follow. 233
remained step, half coach half of; remained 234
road him. looked coachman guard, 235
guard coachman, listened. coachman looked 236
back guard looked back, even emphatic leader pricked 237
ears looked back, without contradicting. 238
stillness consequent cessation rumbling labouring 239
coach, added stillness night, made quiet 240
indeed. panting horses communicated tremulous motion 241
coach, state agitation. hearts 242
passengers beat loud enough perhaps heard; rate, 243
quiet pause audibly expressive people breath, holding 244
breath, pulses quickened expectation. 245
sound horse gallop came fast furiously hill. 246
"so-ho!" guard sang out, loud could roar. "yo there! stand! 247
shall fire!" 248
pace suddenly checked, and, much splashing floundering, 249
man's voice called mist, "is dover mail?" 250
"never mind is!" guard retorted. "what you?" 251
"_is_ dover mail?" 252
"why want know?" 253
"i want passenger, is." 254
"what passenger?" 255
"mr. jarvis lorry." 256
booked passenger showed moment name. guard, 257
coachman, two passengers eyed distrustfully. 258
"keep are," guard called voice mist, 259
"because, make mistake, could never set right 260
lifetime. gentleman name lorry answer straight." 261
"what matter?" asked passenger, then, mildly quavering 262
speech. "who wants me? jerry?" 263
("i like jerry's voice, jerry," growled guard 264
himself. "he's hoarser suits me, jerry.") 265
"yes, mr. lorry." 266
"what matter?" 267
"a despatch sent yonder. t. co." 268
"i know messenger, guard," said mr. lorry, getting 269
road--assisted behind swiftly politely two 270
passengers, immediately scrambled coach, shut door, 271
pulled window. "he may come close; there's nothing wrong." 272
"i hope ain't, can't make 'nation sure that," said 273
guard, gruff soliloquy. "hallo you!" 274
"well! hallo you!" said jerry, hoarsely before. 275
"come footpace! d'ye mind me? got holsters 276
saddle o' yourn, let see hand go nigh 'em. i'm devil 277
quick mistake, make one takes form lead. 278
let's look you." 279
figures horse rider came slowly eddying mist, 280
came side mail, passenger stood. rider 281
stooped, and, casting eyes guard, handed passenger 282
small folded paper. rider's horse blown, horse 283
rider covered mud, hoofs horse hat 284
man. 285
"guard!" said passenger, tone quiet business confidence. 286
watchful guard, right hand stock raised 287
blunderbuss, left barrel, eye horseman, 288
answered curtly, "sir." 289
"there nothing apprehend. belong tellson's bank. must 290
know tellson's bank london. going paris business. crown 291
drink. may read this?" 292
"if quick, sir." 293
opened light coach-lamp side, 294
read--first aloud: "'wait dover mam'selle.' 295
long, see, guard. jerry, say answer was, recalled 296
life." 297
jerry started saddle. "that's blazing strange answer, too," 298
said he, hoarsest. 299
"take message back, know received this, 300
well wrote. make best way. good night." 301
words passenger opened coach-door got in; 302
assisted fellow-passengers, expeditiously secreted 303
watches purses boots, making general 304
pretence asleep. definite purpose escape 305
hazard originating kind action. 306
coach lumbered again, heavier wreaths mist closing round 307
began descent. guard soon replaced blunderbuss 308
arm-chest, and, looked rest contents, 309
looked supplementary pistols wore belt, 310
looked smaller chest beneath seat, 311
smith's tools, couple torches, tinder-box. 312

"hallo, joe." 319
"did hear message?" 320
"i did, joe." 321
"what make it, tom?" 322
"nothing all, joe." 323
"that's coincidence, too," guard mused, "for made 324

jerry, left alone mist darkness, dismounted meanwhile, 326
ease spent horse, wipe mud face, 327
shake wet hat-brim, might capable 328
holding half gallon. standing bridle 329
heavily-splashed arm, wheels mail longer within 330

"after gallop temple bar, old lady, trust 333

glancing mare. "'recalled life.' that's blazing strange 335
message. much you, jerry! say, jerry! 336
blazing bad way, recalling life come fashion, 337

iii. night shadows 339
wonderful fact reflect upon, every human creature 340
constituted profound secret mystery every other. 341
solemn consideration, enter great city night, every 342
one darkly clustered houses encloses secret; every 343
room every one encloses secret; every beating 344
heart hundreds thousands breasts there, is, 345

buried treasure things submerged. appointed 351
book shut spring, ever ever, read 352

three passengers shut narrow compass one lumbering old mail 365
coach; mysteries one another, complete 366
coach six, coach sixty, 367
breadth county next. 368
messenger rode back easy trot, stopping pretty often 369
ale-houses way drink, evincing tendency keep 370
counsel, keep hat cocked eyes. eyes 371
assorted well decoration, surface black, 372
depth colour form, much near together--as 373
afraid found something, singly, kept 374
far apart. sinister expression, old cocked-hat like 375
three-cornered spittoon, great muffler chin 376
throat, descended nearly wearer's knees. stopped 377
drink, moved muffler left hand, 378
poured liquor right; soon done, 379
muffled again. 380
"no, jerry, no!" said messenger, harping one theme rode. 381
"it you, jerry. jerry, honest tradesman, 382
suit _your_ line business! recalled--! bust think he'd 383

message perplexed mind degree fain, several 385
times, take hat scratch head. except crown, 386
raggedly bald, stiff, black hair, standing jaggedly 387
it, growing hill almost broad, blunt nose. 388
like smith's work, much like top strongly spiked 389
wall head hair, best players leap-frog might 390

night took shapes arose message, took 395
shapes mare arose _her_ private topics uneasiness. 396
seemed numerous, shied every shadow road. 397
time, mail-coach lumbered, jolted, rattled, bumped upon 398
tedious way, three fellow-inscrutables inside. whom, 399
likewise, shadows night revealed themselves, forms 400
dozing eyes wandering thoughts suggested. 401
tellson's bank run upon mail. bank 402
passenger--with arm drawn leathern strap, 403
lay keep pounding next passenger, 404
driving corner, whenever coach got special 405
jolt--nodded place, half-shut eyes, little 406
coach-windows, coach-lamp dimly gleaming them, 407
bulky bundle opposite passenger, became bank, great 408
stroke business. rattle harness chink money, 409
drafts honoured five minutes even tellson's, 410
foreign home connection, ever paid thrice time. 411
strong-rooms underground, tellson's, valuable 412
stores secrets known passenger (and 413
little knew them), opened him, went among 414
great keys feebly-burning candle, found 415
safe, strong, sound, still, last seen them. 416
but, though bank almost always him, though coach 417
(in confused way, like presence pain opiate) 418
always him, another current impression never 419
ceased run, night. way dig one 420

now, multitude faces showed 422
true face buried person, shadows night 423
indicate; faces man five-and-forty 424
years, differed principally passions expressed, 425
ghastliness worn wasted state. pride, contempt, 426
defiance, stubbornness, submission, lamentation, succeeded one another; 427
varieties sunken cheek, cadaverous colour, emaciated hands 428
figures. face main one face, every head 429
prematurely white. hundred times dozing passenger inquired 430
spectre: 431
"buried long?" 432
answer always same: "almost eighteen years." 433
"you abandoned hope dug out?" 434
"long ago." 435
"you know recalled life?" 436
"they tell so." 437
"i hope care live?" 438
"i can't say." 439
"shall show you? come see her?" 440
answers question various contradictory. sometimes 441
broken reply was, "wait! would kill saw soon." 442
sometimes, given tender rain tears, was, 443
"take her." sometimes staring bewildered, 444
was, "i know her. understand." 445
imaginary discourse, passenger fancy would dig, 446
dig, dig--now spade, great key, 447
hands--to dig wretched creature out. got last, earth 448
hanging face hair, would suddenly fan away dust. 449
passenger would start himself, lower window, get 450
reality mist rain cheek. 451
yet even eyes opened mist rain, moving 452
patch light lamps, hedge roadside retreating 453
jerks, night shadows outside coach would fall train 454
night shadows within. real banking-house temple bar, 455
real business past day, real strong rooms, real express 456

midst them, ghostly face would rise, would accost 458
again. 459
"buried long?" 460
"almost eighteen years." 461
"i hope care live?" 462
"i can't say." 463
dig--dig--dig--until impatient movement one two 464
passengers would admonish pull window, draw arm 465
securely leathern strap, speculate upon two 466
slumbering forms, mind lost hold them, 467
slid away bank grave. 468
"buried long?" 469
"almost eighteen years." 470
"you abandoned hope dug out?" 471
"long ago." 472
words still hearing spoken--distinctly 473
hearing ever spoken words life--when weary 474
passenger started consciousness daylight, found 475
shadows night gone. 476
lowered window, looked rising sun. 477
ridge ploughed land, plough upon left 478
last night horses unyoked; beyond, quiet coppice-wood, 479
many leaves burning red golden yellow still remained 480
upon trees. though earth cold wet, sky clear, 481
sun rose bright, placid, beautiful. 482
"eighteen years!" said passenger, looking sun. "gracious 483
creator day! buried alive eighteen years!" 484

second-hand cares, like second-hand clothes, come easily on. 541
completing resemblance man sitting portrait, 542
mr. lorry dropped sleep. arrival breakfast roused him, 543
said drawer, moved chair it: 544

"now dinner done," carton presently said, "why call 2634

"what health? toast?" 2636
"why, tip tongue. ought be, must be, i'll 2637

"willingly, small return good offices." 2660
"do think particularly like you?" 2661
"really, mr. carton," returned other, oddly disconcerted, "i 2662
asked question." 2663
"but ask question now." 2664
"you acted do; think do." 2665
"_i_ think do," said carton. "i begin good 2666

"nevertheless," pursued darnay, rising ring bell, "there 2668
nothing that, hope, prevent calling reckoning, 2669
parting without ill-blood either side." 2670
carton rejoining, "nothing life!" darnay rang. "do call whole 2671

"i think drinking, mr. carton." 2679
"think? know drinking." 2680
"since must say so, know it." 2681
"then shall likewise know why. disappointed drudge, sir. 2682

"i wonder," said mr. lorry, pausing looking about, "that keeps 2987

"and wonder that?" abrupt inquiry made start. 2989
proceeded miss pross, wild red woman, strong hand, whose 2990
acquaintance first made royal george hotel dover, 2991
since improved. 2992
"i thought--" mr. lorry began. 2993
"pooh! thought!" said miss pross; mr. lorry left off. 2994
"how do?" inquired lady then--sharply, yet 2995
express bore malice. 2996
"i pretty well, thank you," answered mr. lorry, meekness; "how 2997
you?" 2998
"nothing boast of," said miss pross. 2999
"indeed?" 3000
"ah! indeed!" said miss pross. "i much put 3001
ladybird." 3002
"indeed?" 3003
"for gracious sake say something else besides 'indeed,' 3004
fidget death," said miss pross: whose character (dissociated 3005
stature) shortness. 3006
"really, then?" said mr. lorry, amendment. 3007
"really, bad enough," returned miss pross, "but better. yes, 3008
much put out." 3009
"may ask cause?" 3010
"i want dozens people worthy ladybird, 3011
come looking her," said miss pross. 3012
"_do_ dozens come purpose?" 3013
"hundreds," said miss pross. 3014
characteristic lady (as people 3015
time since) whenever original proposition questioned, 3016
exaggerated it. 3017
"dear me!" said mr. lorry, safest remark could think of. 3018
"i lived darling--or darling lived me, 3019
paid it; certainly never done, may take 3020
affidavit, could afforded keep either 3021
nothing--since ten years old. really hard," 3022
said miss pross. 3023
seeing precision hard, mr. lorry shook head; 3024
using important part sort fairy cloak would 3025
fit anything. 3026
"all sorts people least degree worthy pet, 3027
always turning up," said miss pross. "when began it--" 3028
"_i_ began it, miss pross?" 3029
"didn't you? brought father life?" 3030
"oh! _that_ beginning it--" said mr. lorry. 3031
"it ending it, suppose? say, began it, hard 3032
enough; fault find doctor manette, except 3033
worthy daughter, imputation 3034
him, expected anybody be, 3035

multitudes people turning (i could forgiven 3037
him), take ladybird's affections away me." 3038
mr. lorry knew miss pross jealous, also knew 3039
time be, beneath service eccentricity, one 3040
unselfish creatures--found among women--who will, pure love 3041
admiration, bind willing slaves, youth lost 3042
it, beauty never had, accomplishments 3043

pross much nearer lower angels many ladies immeasurably 3050
better got nature art, balances tellson's. 3051
"there never was, be, one man worthy ladybird," said 3052
miss pross; "and brother solomon, made 3053
mistake life." 3054
again: mr. lorry's inquiries miss pross's personal history 3055

stripped everything possessed, stake 3057
speculate with, abandoned poverty evermore, 3058
touch compunction. miss pross's fidelity belief solomon 3059
(deducting mere trifle slight mistake) quite serious 3060
matter mr. lorry, weight good opinion her. 3061
"as happen alone moment, people 3062

sat friendly relations, "let ask you--does doctor, 3064
talking lucie, never refer shoemaking time, yet?" 3065
"never." 3066
"and yet keeps bench tools beside him?" 3067
"ah!" returned miss pross, shaking head. "but say 3068
refer within himself." 3069
"do believe thinks much?" 3070
"i do," said miss pross. 3071
"do imagine--" mr. lorry begun, miss pross took 3072
short with: 3073
"never imagine anything. imagination all." 3074
"i stand corrected; suppose--you go far suppose, 3075
sometimes?" 3076
"now then," said miss pross. 3077
"do suppose," mr. lorry went on, laughing twinkle 3078
bright eye, looked kindly her, "that doctor manette 3079
theory own, preserved years, relative 3080
cause oppressed; perhaps, even name 3081
oppressor?" 3082
"i suppose anything ladybird tells me." 3083
"and is--?" 3084
"that thinks has." 3085
"now angry asking questions; 3086
mere dull man business, woman business." 3087
"dull?" miss pross inquired, placidity. 3088
rather wishing modest adjective away, mr. lorry replied, "no, no, 3089
no. surely not. return business:--is remarkable doctor 3090
manette, unquestionably innocent crime well assured 3091
is, never touch upon question? say me, 3092
though business relations many years ago, 3093
intimate; say fair daughter devotedly 3094
attached, devotedly attached him? believe me, miss 3095
pross, approach topic you, curiosity, 3096
zealous interest." 3097
"well! best understanding, bad's best, tell 3098
me," said miss pross, softened tone apology, "he afraid 3099
whole subject." 3100
"afraid?" 3101
"it's plain enough, think, may be. dreadful 3102
remembrance. besides that, loss grew it. 3103
knowing lost himself, recovered himself, may never 3104
feel certain losing again. alone make 3105
subject pleasant, think." 3106
profounder remark mr. lorry looked for. "true," said 3107
he, "and fearful reflect upon. yet, doubt lurks mind, miss 3108
pross, whether good doctor manette suppression 3109
always shut within him. indeed, doubt uneasiness 3110
sometimes causes led present confidence." 3111
"can't helped," said miss pross, shaking head. "touch 3112
string, instantly changes worse. better leave alone. 3113
short, must leave alone, like like. sometimes, gets 3114

monseigneur one truly noble idea general public business, 3347

reference scarecrows rags nightcaps elsewhere (and 3379
far off, either, watching towers notre dame, almost 3380
equidistant two extremes, could see both), would 3381

"very willingly," said mender roads. defarge escorted 5562

"how say you, jacques?" demanded number one. "to registered?" 5566
"to registered, doomed destruction," returned defarge. 5567
"magnificent!" croaked man craving. 5568
"the chateau, race?" inquired first. 5569
"the chateau race," returned defarge. "extermination." 5570
hungry man repeated, rapturous croak, "magnificent!" began 5571

"jacques," returned defarge, drawing up, "if madame wife 5577

murmur confidence approval, man 5584
hungered, asked: "is rustic sent back soon? hope so. 5585

"eh well! then?" demanded madame, tying another knot, 5799
another enemy strangled. 5800
"well!" said defarge, half complaining half apologetic shrug. 5801
"we shall see triumph." 5802
"we shall helped it," returned madame, extended hand 5803

madame, teeth set, tied terrible knot indeed. 5808
"hold!" cried defarge, reddening little felt charged 5809
cowardice; "i too, dear, stop nothing." 5810
"yes! weakness sometimes need see victim 5811

customers ceased talking, began gradually drop 5835

"good day, madame," said new-comer. 5837
"good day, monsieur." 5838
said aloud, added herself, resumed knitting: 5839
"hah! good day, age forty, height five feet nine, black 5840

"have goodness give little glass old cognac, 5845

madame complied polite air. 5847
"marvellous cognac this, madame!" 5848
first time ever complimented, madame 5849
defarge knew enough antecedents know better. said, 5850
however, cognac flattered, took knitting. 5851
visitor watched fingers moments, took opportunity 5852
observing place general. 5853
"you knit great skill, madame." 5854
"i accustomed it." 5855
"a pretty pattern too!" 5856
"_you_ think so?" said madame, looking smile. 5857
"decidedly. may one ask for?" 5858
"pastime," said madame, still looking smile 5859
fingers moved nimbly. 5860
"not use?" 5861
"that depends. may find use one day. do--well," said 5862
madame, drawing breath nodding head stern kind 5863
coquetry, "i'll use it!" 5864
remarkable; but, taste saint antoine seemed 5865
decidedly opposed rose head-dress madame defarge. two 5866
men entered separately, order drink, when, 5867

"_john_," thought madame, checking work fingers knitted, 5875
eyes looked stranger. "stay long enough, shall knit 5876
'barsad' go." 5877
"you husband, madame?" 5878
"i have." 5879
"children?" 5880
"no children." 5881
"business seems bad?" 5882
"business bad; people poor." 5883
"ah, unfortunate, miserable people! oppressed, too--as say." 5884
"as _you_ say," madame retorted, correcting him, deftly knitting 5885
extra something name boded good. 5886
"pardon me; certainly said so, naturally think so. 5887

"_i_ think?" returned madame, high voice. "i husband 5889

stood air gossiping gallantry, leaning elbow madame 5896
defarge's little counter, occasionally sipping cognac. 5897
"a bad business this, madame, gaspard's execution. ah! poor 5898
gaspard!" sigh great compassion. 5899
"my faith!" returned madame, coolly lightly, "if people use knives 5900
purposes, pay it. knew beforehand 5901
price luxury was; paid price." 5902
"i believe," said spy, dropping soft voice tone 5903

"is there?" asked madame, vacantly. 5908
"is not?" 5909
"--here husband!" said madame defarge. 5910
keeper wine-shop entered door, spy saluted 5911
touching hat, saying, engaging smile, "good day, 5912
jacques!" defarge stopped short, stared him. 5913
"good day, jacques!" spy repeated; quite much 5914
confidence, quite easy smile stare. 5915
"you deceive yourself, monsieur," returned keeper wine-shop. 5916
"you mistake another. name. ernest defarge." 5917
"it same," said spy, airily, discomfited too: "good 5918

"you seem know quarter well; say, better do?" 5935
observed defarge. 5936
"not all, hope know better. profoundly interested 5937

"hah!" muttered defarge. 5939
"the pleasure conversing you, monsieur defarge, recalls me," 5940
pursued spy, "that honour cherishing interesting 5941

"indeed!" said defarge, much indifference. 5943
"yes, indeed. doctor manette released, you, old domestic, 5944

"yes?" said defarge. 5957
"you hear much now?" said spy. 5958
"no," said defarge. 5959
"in effect," madame struck in, looking work little 5960

"perfectly so, madame," replied spy. "she going married." 5965
"going?" echoed madame. "she pretty enough married long 5966

"oh! know english." 5968
"i perceive tongue is," returned madame; "and tongue is, 5969

ways, side tree, many many time; but, 6061
time quite like other, nothing could make so. 6062
"and happy to-night, dear father. deeply happy 6063
love heaven blessed--my love charles, charles's love 6064
me. but, life still consecrated you, 6065
marriage arranged would part us, even 6066
length streets, unhappy 6067

even was, could command voice. 6069
sad moonlight, clasped neck, laid face 6070

sun is--as light called human life is--at coming 6072
going. 6073
"dearest dear! tell me, last time, feel quite, 6074
quite sure, new affections mine, new duties mine, 6075
ever interpose us? _i_ know well, know it? 6076

father answered, cheerful firmness conviction could 6078
scarcely assumed, "quite sure, darling! that," 6079
added, tenderly kissed her: "my future far brighter, lucie, 6080
seen marriage, could been--nay, ever 6081

"if could hope _that_, father!--" 6083
"believe it, love! indeed so. consider natural plain 6084
is, dear, so. you, devoted young, cannot 6085
fully appreciate anxiety felt life 6086

moved hand towards lips, took his, repeated 6088
word. 6089
"--wasted, child--should wasted, struck aside 6090
natural order things--for sake. unselfishness cannot entirely 6091

"if never seen charles, father, quite happy 6094

"my child, see him, charles. 6098

sensation words ears; remembered long 6104
afterwards. 6105
"see!" said doctor beauvais, raising hand towards moon. 6106
"i looked prison-window, could bear 6107

strange thrill heard go back time, 6116

cheerfulness felicity dire endurance over. 6119
"i looked her, speculating thousands times upon unborn 6120
child rent. whether alive. whether 6121
born alive, poor mother's shock killed it. whether 6122
son would day avenge father. (there time 6123
imprisonment, desire vengeance unbearable.) whether 6124
son would never know father's story; might even live 6125
weigh possibility father's disappeared 6126
act. whether daughter would grow woman." 6127
drew closer him, kissed cheek hand. 6128
"i pictured daughter, myself, perfectly forgetful 6129
me--rather, altogether ignorant me, unconscious me. 6130
cast years age, year year. seen married 6131
man knew nothing fate. altogether perished 6132
remembrance living, next generation place 6133

"my father! even hear thoughts daughter 6135
never existed, strikes heart child." 6136
"you, lucie? consolation restoration 6137
brought me, remembrances arise, pass us 6138

"she knew nothing you. cared nothing you." 6140
"so! moonlight nights, sadness silence 6141

like sorrowful sense peace, emotion pain 6143

"the figure not; the--the--image; fancy?" 6149
"no. another thing. stood disturbed sense 6150

"in peaceful state, imagined her, moonlight, 6159

"i child, father, half good, love 6164

"and showed children," said doctor beauvais, "and 6166
heard me, taught pity me. passed 6167
prison state, kept far frowning walls, looked 6168
bars, spoke whispers. could never deliver me; 6169
imagined always brought back showing things. 6170
then, blessed relief tears, fell upon knees, 6171
blessed her." 6172
"i child, hope, father. dear, dear, bless 6173

"lucie, recall old troubles reason to-night 6175

embraced her, solemnly commended heaven, humbly thanked 6179
heaven bestowed him. by-and-bye, went 6180

"a young lady's walking shoe," muttered, without looking up. "it 6332

"but, doctor manette. look me!" 6334
obeyed, old mechanically submissive manner, without pausing 6335

"you know me, dear friend? think again. proper 6337

meanwhile, doctor removed seat window, 6412

therefore, breakfast done cleared away, 6471
doctor left together, mr. lorry said, feelingly: 6472
"my dear manette, anxious opinion, confidence, 6473
curious case deeply interested; say, 6474
curious me; perhaps, better information may less 6475
so." 6476
glancing hands, discoloured late work, 6477
doctor looked troubled, listened attentively. already glanced 6478
hands once. 6479
"doctor manette," said mr. lorry, touching affectionately 6480
arm, "the case case particularly dear friend mine. pray 6481
give mind it, advise well sake--and all, 6482

"if understand," said doctor, subdued tone, "some mental 6484

doctor, low voice, asked, "of long duration?" 6502
"nine days nights." 6503
"how show itself? infer," glancing hands again, "in 6504

"that fact." 6506
"now, ever see him," asked doctor, distinctly 6507

"once." 6510
"and relapse fell him, respects--or 6511

"i think respects." 6513
"you spoke daughter. daughter know relapse?" 6514
"no. kept her, hope always kept her. 6515

doctor grasped hand, murmured, "that kind. 6517

"now, dear manette," said mr. lorry, length, 6520

doctor manette sat meditating earnest words spoken, 6536
mr. lorry press him. 6537
"i think probable," said doctor, breaking silence effort, 6538
"that relapse described, dear friend, quite 6539

"very much." said involuntary shudder. 6542
"you idea apprehension weighs sufferer's 6543

"would remember took place relapse?" asked mr. lorry, 6562
natural hesitation. 6563
doctor looked desolately round room, shook head, 6564
answered, low voice, "not all." 6565
"now, future," hinted mr. lorry. 6566
"as future," said doctor, recovering firmness, "i 6567

"what noise?" said doctor, turning towards window. 8488
"don't look!" cried mr. lorry. "don't look out! manette, life, 8489

lorry business hours came round, this:--that right 8608
imperil tellson's sheltering wife emigrant prisoner 8609

safest dwelling-place distracted state city. but, 8616
consideration suggested him, repudiated him; lived 8617
violent quarter, doubtless influential there, deep 8618
dangerous workings. 8619
noon coming, doctor returning, every minute's delay 8620
tending compromise tellson's, mr. lorry advised lucie. said 8621
father spoken hiring lodging short term, 8622
quarter, near banking-house. business objection 8623
this, foresaw even well charles, 8624
released, could hope leave city, mr. lorry 8625
went quest lodging, found suitable one, high 8626

heavily day lagged him. 8634

alone room previous night, considering 8636
next, heard foot upon stair. moments, 8637
man stood presence, who, keenly observant look him, 8638

"your servant," said mr. lorry. "do know me?" 8640
strongly made man dark curling hair, forty-five 8641
fifty years age. answer repeated, without change 8642
emphasis, words: 8643
"do know me?" 8644
"i seen somewhere." 8645
"perhaps wine-shop?" 8646
much interested agitated, mr. lorry said: "you come doctor 8647
manette?" 8648
"yes. come doctor manette." 8649
"and says he? send me?" 8650
defarge gave anxious hand, open scrap paper. bore 8651
words doctor's writing: 8652
"charles safe, cannot safely leave place yet. 8653

dated la force, within hour. 8656
"will accompany me," said mr. lorry, joyfully relieved reading 8657
note aloud, "to wife resides?" 8658
"yes," returned defarge. 8659
scarcely noticing yet, curiously reserved mechanical 8660
way defarge spoke, mr. lorry put hat went 8661
courtyard. there, found two women; one, knitting. 8662
"madame defarge, surely!" said mr. lorry, left exactly 8663
attitude seventeen years ago. 8664
"it she," observed husband. 8665
"does madame go us?" inquired mr. lorry, seeing moved 8666

"yes. may able recognise faces know persons. 8668

beginning struck defarge's manner, mr. lorry looked dubiously 8670
him, led way. women followed; second woman 8671

passed intervening streets quickly might, 8673
ascended staircase new domicile, admitted jerry, 8674
found lucie weeping, alone. thrown transport 8675

delivered note--little thinking near 8677
night, might, chance, done him. 8678
"dearest,--take courage. well, father 8679
influence around me. cannot answer this. 8680
kiss child me." 8681
writing. much, however, received 8682
it, turned defarge wife, kissed one 8683
hands knitted. passionate, loving, thankful, womanly 8684
action, hand made response--dropped cold heavy, took 8685
knitting again. 8686
something touch gave lucie check. stopped 8687
act putting note bosom, and, hands yet 8688

eyebrows forehead cold, impassive stare. 8690
"my dear," said mr. lorry, striking explain; "there frequent 8691
risings streets; and, although likely ever 8692
trouble you, madame defarge wishes see power 8693
protect times, end may know them--that 8694
may identify them. believe," said mr. lorry, rather halting 8695
reassuring words, stony manner three impressed 8696
upon more, "i state case, citizen defarge?" 8697
defarge looked gloomily wife, gave answer 8698
gruff sound acquiescence. 8699
"you better, lucie," said mr. lorry, could 8700
propitiate, tone manner, "have dear child here, 8701
good pross. good pross, defarge, english lady, knows 8702
french." 8703
lady question, whose rooted conviction 8704
match foreigner, shaken distress and, danger, 8705
appeared folded arms, observed english vengeance, 8706
eyes first encountered, "well, sure, boldface! hope 8707
_you_ pretty well!" also bestowed british cough madame 8708
defarge; but, neither two took much heed her. 8709
"is child?" said madame defarge, stopping work 8710
first time, pointing knitting-needle little lucie 8711
finger fate. 8712
"yes, madame," answered mr. lorry; "this poor prisoner's darling 8713
daughter, child." 8714
shadow attendant madame defarge party seemed fall 8715
threatening dark child, mother instinctively 8716
kneeled ground beside her, held breast. 8717
shadow attendant madame defarge party seemed fall, 8718
threatening dark, mother child. 8719
"it enough, husband," said madame defarge. "i seen them. 8720
may go." 8721
but, suppressed manner enough menace it--not visible 8722
presented, indistinct withheld--to alarm lucie saying, 8723
laid appealing hand madame defarge's dress: 8724
"you good poor husband. harm. 8725
help see can?" 8726
"your husband business here," returned madame defarge, looking 8727
perfect composure. "it daughter father 8728

"for sake, then, merciful husband. child's sake! 8730
put hands together pray merciful. 8731
afraid others." 8732
madame defarge received compliment, looked husband. 8733
defarge, uneasily biting thumb-nail looking her, 8734
collected face sterner expression. 8735
"what husband says little letter?" asked madame 8736
defarge, lowering smile. "influence; says something touching 8737
influence?" 8738
"that father," said lucie, hurriedly taking paper 8739
breast, alarmed eyes questioner it, "has 8740
much influence around him." 8741
"surely release him!" said madame defarge. "let so." 8742
"as wife mother," cried lucie, earnestly, "i implore 8743
pity exercise power possess, 8744

madame defarge looked, coldly ever, suppliant, said, 8747
turning friend vengeance: 8748
"the wives mothers used see, since little 8749

"we seen nothing else," returned vengeance. 8755
"we borne long time," said madame defarge, turning eyes 8756
upon lucie. "judge you! likely trouble one wife 8757
mother would much us now?" 8758
resumed knitting went out. vengeance followed. defarge 8759
went last, closed door. 8760
"courage, dear lucie," said mr. lorry, raised her. "courage, 8761
courage! far goes well us--much, much better 8762
late gone many poor souls. cheer up, thankful heart." 8763
"i thankless, hope, dreadful woman seems throw 8764
shadow hopes." 8765
"tut, tut!" said mr. lorry; "what despondency brave 8766
little breast? shadow indeed! substance it, lucie." 8767
shadow manner defarges dark upon himself, 8768
that, secret mind troubled greatly. 8769
iv. calm storm 8770

gentlest solicitude--had made litter escorted 8821
carefully spot--had caught weapons plunged 8822
anew butchery dreadful, doctor covered eyes 8823
hands, swooned away midst it. 8824
mr. lorry received confidences, watched face 8825
friend sixty-two years age, misgiving arose within 8826
dread experiences would revive old danger. 8827
but, never seen friend present aspect: never 8828
known present character. first time doctor 8829
felt, now, suffering strength power. first time 8830
felt sharp fire, slowly forged iron 8831
could break prison door daughter's husband, deliver him. 8832
"it tended good end, friend; mere waste ruin. 8833
beloved child helpful restoring myself, 8834
helpful restoring dearest part her; aid 8835
heaven it!" thus, doctor manette. jarvis lorry saw 8836
kindled eyes, resolute face, calm strong look bearing 8837
man whose life always seemed stopped, like 8838
clock, many years, set going energy 8839
lain dormant cessation usefulness, believed. 8840
greater things doctor time contend with, would 8841
yielded persevering purpose. kept 8842
place, physician, whose business degrees 8843
mankind, bond free, rich poor, bad good, used 8844
personal influence wisely, soon inspecting physician 8845
three prisons, among la force. could assure lucie 8846
husband longer confined alone, mixed 8847
general body prisoners; saw husband weekly, brought sweet 8848
messages her, straight lips; sometimes husband 8849
sent letter (though never doctor's hand), 8850
permitted write him: for, among many wild suspicions 8851
plots prisons, wildest pointed emigrants 8852
known made friends permanent connections abroad. 8853
new life doctor's anxious life, doubt; still, 8854
sagacious mr. lorry saw new sustaining pride it. 8855
nothing unbecoming tinged pride; natural worthy one; 8856
observed curiosity. doctor knew, 8857
time, imprisonment associated minds daughter 8858
friend, personal affliction, deprivation, weakness. 8859
changed, knew invested 8860
old trial forces looked charles's 8861
ultimate safety deliverance, became far exalted change, 8862
took lead direction, required weak, 8863
trust strong. preceding relative positions 8864
lucie reversed, yet liveliest gratitude 8865
affection could reverse them, could pride 8866
rendering service rendered much him. "all 8867
curious see," thought mr. lorry, amiably shrewd way, "but 8868
natural right; so, take lead, dear friend, keep it; 8869
better hands." 8870
but, though doctor tried hard, never ceased trying, get 8871
charles darnay set liberty, least get brought trial, 8872
public current time set strong fast him. new 8873
era began; king tried, doomed, beheaded; republic 8874
liberty, equality, fraternity, death, declared victory death 8875

windows heaven shut, opened! 8887

"hush, dear! again?" lucie remonstrated. 9461
"well, sweet," said miss pross, nodding head emphatically, "the 9462

"what that?" cried, once. 9490
"my dear!" said father, stopping story, laying hand 9491
hers, "command yourself. disordered state in! 9492
least thing--nothing--startles you! _you_, father's daughter!" 9493
"i thought, father," said lucie, excusing herself, pale face 9494

"my love, staircase still death." 9496
said word, blow struck upon door. 9497
"oh father, father. be! hide charles. save him!" 9498
"my child," said doctor, rising, laying hand upon 9499

"you know him, said. know me?" 9519
"yes, know you, citizen doctor." 9520
"we know you, citizen doctor," said three. 9521

"will answer question then? happen?" 9524
"citizen doctor," said first, reluctantly, "he denounced 9525
section saint antoine. citizen," pointing second 9526

"he accused saint antoine." 9529
"of what?" asked doctor. 9530
"citizen doctor," said first, former reluctance, "ask 9531

"one word," doctor entreated. "will tell denounced him?" 9535
"it rule," answered first; "but ask saint 9536

"well! truly rule. denounced--and gravely--by 9540
citizen citizeness defarge. one other." 9541
"what other?" 9542
"do _you_ ask, citizen doctor?" 9543

popular high-shouldered shaggy black spencer looked, attitude, 9576
like slumbering bears dogs; two outlandish customers approached 9577

likeliest occurrence. everybody looked see somebody fall, 9585
saw man woman standing staring other; man 9586

said disappointing anti-climax, disciples 9589
good republican brutus antiquity, except something 9590
voluble loud, would much hebrew chaldean miss 9591
pross protector, though ears. but, 9592
ears anything surprise. for, must recorded, 9593
miss pross lost amazement agitation, but, 9594
mr. cruncher--though seemed separate individual 9595
account--was state greatest wonder. 9596
"what matter?" said man caused miss pross scream; 9597
speaking vexed, abrupt voice (though low tone), 9598
english. 9599
"oh, solomon, dear solomon!" cried miss pross, clapping hands again. 9600
"after setting eyes upon hearing long time, 9601
find here!" 9602
"don't call solomon. want death me?" asked 9603
man, furtive, frightened way. 9604
"brother, brother!" cried miss pross, bursting tears. "have ever 9605

"then hold meddlesome tongue," said solomon, "and come out, 9607
want speak me. pay wine, come out. who's man?" 9608
miss pross, shaking loving dejected head means 9609
affectionate brother, said tears, "mr. cruncher." 9610
"let come too," said solomon. "does think ghost?" 9611
apparently, mr. cruncher did, judge looks. said 9612
word, however, miss pross, exploring depths reticule 9613
tears great difficulty paid wine. 9614
so, solomon turned followers good republican brutus 9615

language, caused relapse former places 9617
pursuits. 9618
"now," said solomon, stopping dark street corner, "what 9619

"how dreadfully unkind brother nothing ever turned love away 9621

affection." 9623
"there. confound it! there," said solomon, making dab miss pross's 9624
lips own. "now content?" 9625
miss pross shook head wept silence. 9626
"if expect surprised," said brother solomon, "i 9627

saying affectionate word, however, far grudging 9649
condescension patronage could shown relative 9650
merits positions reversed (which invariably case, 9651
world over), mr. cruncher, touching shoulder, 9652
hoarsely unexpectedly interposed following singular 9653
question: 9654
"i say! might ask favour? whether name john solomon, 9655
solomon john?" 9656
official turned towards sudden distrust. 9657
previously uttered word. 9658
"come!" said mr. cruncher. "speak out, know." (which, way, 9659
could himself.) "john solomon, solomon john? 9660

"well, well," reasoned defarge, "but one must stop somewhere. all, 11094
question still where?" 11095
"at extermination," said madame. 11096
"magnificent!" croaked jacques three. vengeance, also, highly 11097
approved. 11098
"extermination good doctrine, wife," said defarge, rather 11099
troubled; "in general, say nothing it. doctor 11100
suffered much; seen to-day; observed face 11101

"no!" protested defarge. "not lift glass would it! 11120

took advice. sister, mrs. joe, throwing door wide open, 12550
finding obstruction behind it, immediately divined cause, 12551
applied tickler investigation. concluded throwing 12552
me--i often served connubial missile--at joe, who, glad get hold 12553
terms, passed chimney quietly fenced 12554

"where been, young monkey?" said mrs. joe, stamping 12556
foot. "tell directly wear away fret 12557

"i churchyard," said i, stool, crying 12560
rubbing myself. 12561
"churchyard!" repeated sister. "if warn't 12562

"you did," said i. 12565
"and it, like know?" exclaimed sister. 12566

"i don't!" said sister. "i'd never again! know that. may 12568
truly say i've never apron mine since born were. 12569
bad enough blacksmith's wife (and gargery) without 12570

thoughts strayed question looked disconsolately 12572
fire. fugitive marshes ironed leg, 12573
mysterious young man, file, food, dreadful pledge 12574
commit larceny sheltering premises, rose 12575
avenging coals. 12576
"hah!" said mrs. joe, restoring tickler station. "churchyard, 12577
indeed! may well say churchyard, two." one us, by, 12578
said all. "you'll drive churchyard betwixt you, one 12579
days, o, pr-r-recious pair without me!" 12580
applied set tea-things, joe peeped 12581

calculating kind pair practically make, 12583
grievous circumstances foreshadowed. that, sat feeling 12584
right-side flaxen curls whisker, following mrs. joe 12585
blue eyes, manner always squally times. 12586
sister trenchant way cutting bread butter us, 12587
never varied. first, left hand jammed loaf hard 12588
fast bib,--where sometimes got pin it, 12589
sometimes needle, afterwards got mouths. 12590
took butter (not much) knife spread loaf, 12591
apothecary kind way, making plaster,--using 12592
sides knife slapping dexterity, trimming moulding 12593
butter round crust. then, gave knife final smart 12594
wipe edge plaster, sawed thick round 12595
loaf: finally, separating loaf, hewed 12596
two halves, joe got one, other. 12597
present occasion, though hungry, dared eat 12598
slice. felt must something reserve dreadful 12599
acquaintance, ally still dreadful young man. knew 12600
mrs. joe's housekeeping strictest kind, 12601
larcenous researches might find nothing available safe. therefore 12602
resolved put hunk bread butter leg 12603

good-natured companionship me, evening habit compare 12610
way bit slices, silently holding 12611
other's admiration then,--which stimulated us new exertions. 12612
to-night, joe several times invited me, display fast 12613
diminishing slice, enter upon usual friendly competition; 12614
found me, time, yellow mug tea one knee, 12615
untouched bread butter other. last, desperately 12616
considered thing contemplated must done, 12617
best done least improbable manner consistent 12618
circumstances. took advantage moment joe looked 12619

joe evidently made uncomfortable supposed loss 12621
appetite, took thoughtful bite slice, 12622
seem enjoy. turned mouth much longer 12623
usual, pondering good deal, gulped like 12624
pill. take another bite, got head 12625

"what's matter now?" said she, smartly, put cup. 12631
"i say, know!" muttered joe, shaking head serious 12632
remonstrance. "pip, old chap! mischief. it'll stick 12633
somewhere. can't chawed it, pip." 12634
"what's matter now?" repeated sister, sharply before. 12635
"if cough trifle up, pip, i'd recommend it," 12636
said joe, aghast. "manners manners, still elth's 12637
elth." 12638
time, sister quite desperate, pounced joe, 12639
and, taking two whiskers, knocked head little 12640
wall behind him, sat corner, looking guiltily 12641
on. 12642
"now, perhaps mention what's matter," said sister, 12643
breath, "you staring great stuck pig." 12644
joe looked helpless way, took helpless bite, 12645
looked again. 12646
"you know, pip," said joe, solemnly, last bite cheek, 12647
speaking confidential voice, two quite alone, 12648
"you always friends, i'd last tell upon you, 12649

sister made dive me, fished hair, saying 12658
nothing awful words, "you come along dosed." 12659

held bootjack. joe got half pint; made 12668
swallow (much disturbance, sat slowly munching 12669
meditating fire), "because turn." judging 12670
myself, say certainly turn afterwards, 12671
none before. 12672
conscience dreadful thing accuses man boy; when, 12673
case boy, secret burden co-operates another secret 12674

"what mean, joe?" said i. 12700
mrs. joe, always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly, 12701
"escaped. escaped." administering definition like tar-water. 12702
mrs. joe sat head bending needlework, put 12703
mouth forms saying joe, "what's convict?" joe put 12704
mouth forms returning highly elaborate answer, 12705
could make nothing single word "pip." 12706

"mrs. joe," said i, last resort, "i like know--if 12723
much mind--where firing comes from?" 12724
"lord bless boy!" exclaimed sister, quite mean 12725
rather contrary. "from hulks!" 12726
"oh-h!" said i, looking joe. "hulks!" 12727
joe gave reproachful cough, much say, "well, told so." 12728
"and please, what's hulks?" said i. 12729
"that's way boy!" exclaimed sister, pointing 12730
needle thread, shaking head me. "answer one 12731
question, he'll ask dozen directly. hulks prison-ships, 12732
right 'cross th' meshes." always used name marshes, 12733

"i wonder who's put prison-ships, they're put there?" said 12735
i, general way, quiet desperation. 12736

joined stragglers village, weather 13377
cold threatening, way dreary, footing bad, darkness coming 13378

heart thumping like blacksmith joe's broad shoulder, 13406
looked sign convicts. could see none, could 13407
hear none. mr. wopsle greatly alarmed once, 13408
blowing hard breathing; knew sounds time, 13409

start, thought heard file still going; 13411

long loud. nay, seemed two shouts raised 13421
together,--if one might judge confusion sound. 13422
effect sergeant nearest men speaking 13423
breath, joe came up. another moment's listening, 13424
joe (who good judge) agreed, mr. wopsle (who bad judge) 13425
agreed. sergeant, decisive man, ordered sound 13426
answered, course changed, men 13427
make towards "at double." slanted right 13428
(where east was), joe pounded away wonderfully, 13429
hold tight keep seat. 13430
run indeed now, joe called, two words 13431
spoke time, "a winder." banks banks, gates, 13432
splashing dikes, breaking among coarse rushes: man cared 13433
went. came nearer shouting, became 13434
apparent made one voice. sometimes, 13435
seemed stop altogether, soldiers stopped. broke 13436
again, soldiers made greater rate ever, 13437
them. while, run down, could hear one 13438
voice calling "murder!" another voice, "convicts! runaways! guard! 13439
way runaway convicts!" voices would seem 13440
stifled struggle, would break again. 13441
come this, soldiers ran like deer, joe too. 13442
sergeant ran first, run noise quite down, two 13443
men ran close upon him. pieces cocked levelled 13444
ran in. 13445
"here men!" panted sergeant, struggling bottom 13446

asunder!" 13448
water splashing, mud flying, oaths sworn, 13449
blows struck, men went ditch 13450
help sergeant, dragged out, separately, convict 13451
one. bleeding panting execrating struggling; 13452
course knew directly. 13453
"mind!" said convict, wiping blood face ragged 13454
sleeves, shaking torn hair fingers: "i took him! give 13455
you! mind that!" 13456
"it's much particular about," said sergeant; "it'll 13457
small good, man, plight yourself. handcuffs there!" 13458
"i expect good. want good 13459

knows it. that's enough me." 13461
convict livid look at, and, addition old 13462
bruised left side face, seemed bruised torn over. 13463
could much get breath speak, 13464
separately handcuffed, leaned upon soldier keep 13465
falling. 13466
"take notice, guard,--he tried murder me," first words. 13467
"tried murder him?" said convict, disdainfully. "try, 13468
it? took him, giv' up; that's done. 13469
prevented getting marshes, dragged here,--dragged 13470
far way back. he's gentleman, please, 13471
villain. now, hulks got gentleman again, me. murder 13472
him? worth while, too, murder him, could worse drag 13473
back!" 13474
one still gasped, "he tried--he tried-to--murder me. 13475
bear--bear witness." 13476
"lookee here!" said convict sergeant. "single-handed got 13477
clear prison-ship; made dash done it. could ha' got 13478
clear death-cold flats likewise--look leg: find 13479

fugitive, evidently extreme horror 13486
companion, repeated, "he tried murder me. dead 13487

"he lies!" said convict, fierce energy. "he's liar born, 13489
he'll die liar. look face; ain't written there? let turn 13490
eyes me. defy it." 13491
other, effort scornful smile, could not, however, 13492
collect nervous working mouth set expression, looked 13493
soldiers, looked marshes sky, 13494
certainly look speaker. 13495
"do see him?" pursued convict. "do see villain is? 13496
see grovelling wandering eyes? that's looked 13497
tried together. never looked me." 13498
other, always working working dry lips turning eyes 13499
restlessly far near, last turn moment 13500
speaker, words, "you much look at," 13501
half-taunting glance bound hands. point, convict 13502
became frantically exasperated, would rushed upon 13503
interposition soldiers. "didn't tell you," said 13504
convict then, "that would murder me, could?" one 13505
could see shook fear, broke upon 13506
lips curious white flakes, like thin snow. 13507
"enough parley," said sergeant. "light torches." 13508
one soldiers, carried basket lieu gun, went 13509
knee open it, convict looked round first time, 13510
saw me. alighted joe's back brink ditch 13511
came up, moved since. looked eagerly 13512
looked me, slightly moved hands shook head. 13513

attentive. 13519
soldier basket soon got light, lighted three four 13520
torches, took one distributed others. 13521
almost dark before, seemed quite dark, soon afterwards 13522
dark. departed spot, four soldiers standing 13523
ring, fired twice air. presently saw torches kindled 13524
distance behind us, others marshes opposite 13525
bank river. "all right," said sergeant. "march." 13526
gone far three cannon fired ahead us 13527
sound seemed burst something inside ear. "you expected 13528
board," said sergeant convict; "they know coming. 13529
straggle, man. close here." 13530
two kept apart, walked surrounded separate guard. 13531
hold joe's hand now, joe carried one torches. mr. 13532
wopsle going back, joe resolved see out, 13533
went party. reasonably good path now, mostly 13534
edge river, divergence dike 13535
came, miniature windmill muddy sluice-gate. 13536
looked round, could see lights coming us. 13537
torches carried dropped great blotches fire upon track, 13538
could see those, too, lying smoking flaring. could see nothing 13539
else black darkness. lights warmed air us 13540
pitchy blaze, two prisoners seemed rather like that, 13541
limped along midst muskets. could go fast, 13542
lameness; spent, two three times 13543
halt rested. 13544
hour travelling, came rough wooden hut 13545
landing-place. guard hut, challenged, 13546
sergeant answered. then, went hut, 13547
smell tobacco whitewash, bright fire, lamp, 13548
stand muskets, drum, low wooden bedstead, like 13549
overgrown mangle without machinery, capable holding dozen 13550
soldiers once. three four soldiers lay upon 13551
great-coats much interested us, lifted heads 13552
took sleepy stare, lay again. sergeant made 13553
kind report, entry book, convict 13554
call convict drafted guard, go board 13555
first. 13556
convict never looked me, except once. stood 13557
hut, stood fire looking thoughtfully it, putting 13558
feet turns upon hob, looking thoughtfully 13559
pitied recent adventures. suddenly, turned 13560
sergeant, remarked,-- 13561
"i wish say something respecting escape. may prevent 13562
persons laying suspicion alonger me." 13563
"you say like," returned sergeant, standing coolly 13564
looking arms folded, "but call say 13565
here. opportunity enough say it, hear it, 13566
done with, know." 13567
"i know, another pint, separate matter. man can't 13568
starve; least can't. took wittles, willage 13569

"you mean stole," said sergeant. 13571
"and i'll tell from. blacksmith's." 13572
"halloa!" said sergeant, staring joe. 13573
"halloa, pip!" said joe, staring me. 13574
"it broken wittles--that's was--and dram liquor, 13575
pie." 13576
"have happened miss article pie, blacksmith?" asked 13577
sergeant, confidentially. 13578
"my wife did, moment came in. know, pip?" 13579
"so," said convict, turning eyes joe moody manner, 13580
without least glance me,--"so blacksmith, you? 13581
i'm sorry say, i've eat pie." 13582
"god knows welcome it,--so far ever mine," returned 13583
joe, saving remembrance mrs. joe. "we know 13584
done, starved death it, poor miserable 13585
fellow-creatur.--would us, pip?" 13586
something noticed before, clicked man's throat 13587
again, turned back. boat returned, guard 13588
ready, followed landing-place made rough stakes 13589
stones, saw put boat, rowed crew 13590

shore, like wicked noah's ark. cribbed barred moored 13596
massive rusty chains, prison-ship seemed young eyes 13597

"i like be," said i, glancing slate held it; 13741
misgiving writing rather hilly. 13742

"how spell gargery, joe?" asked him, modest patronage. 13758
"i spell all," said joe. 13759
"but supposing did?" 13760
"it can't supposed," said joe. "tho' i'm uncommon fond reading, 13761

"are you, joe?" 13763
"on-common. give me," said joe, "a good book, good newspaper, 13764

"didn't ever go school, joe, little me?" 13770
"no, pip." 13771
"why ever go school, joe, little me?" 13772
"well, pip," said joe, taking poker, settling 13773
usual occupation thoughtful, slowly raking fire 13774
lower bars; "i'll tell you. father, pip, given 13775

"what play, boy?" asked estella myself, greatest 14234
disdain. 14235
"nothing beggar neighbor, miss." 14236
"beggar him," said miss havisham estella. sat cards. 14237
began understand everything room 14238

trodden ragged. without arrest everything, standing still 14245
pale decayed objects, even withered bridal dress 14246
collapsed form could looked like grave-clothes, long 14247

"you say nothing her," remarked miss havisham me, looked 14264
on. "she says many hard things you, say nothing her. 14265

"i like say," stammered. 14267
"tell ear," said miss havisham, bending down. 14268

convinced miss havisham would understood; although 14431
perfectly incomprehensible me, entertained impression 14432
would something coarse treacherous dragging 14433

face shoved kitchen wall. 14436
worst bullying old pumblechook, preyed upon 14437
devouring curiosity informed seen heard, came 14438
gaping chaise-cart tea-time, details divulged 14439
him. mere sight torment, fishy eyes mouth 14440
open, sandy hair inquisitively end, waistcoat heaving 14441
windy arithmetic, made vicious reticence. 14442
"well, boy," uncle pumblechook began, soon seated 14443
chair honor fire. "how get town?" 14444
answered, "pretty well, sir," sister shook fist me. 14445
"pretty well?" mr. pumblechook repeated. "pretty well answer. tell 14446

discovered new idea, "i mean pretty well." 14451
sister exclamation impatience going fly me,--i 14452
shadow defence, joe busy forge,--when mr. 14453
pumblechook interposed "no! lose temper. leave 14454
lad me, ma'am; leave lad me." mr. pumblechook turned 14455
towards him, going cut hair, said,-- 14456
"first (to get thoughts order): forty-three pence?" 14457
calculated consequences replying "four hundred pound," 14458
finding me, went near answer could--which 14459
somewhere eightpence off. mr. pumblechook put 14460
pence-table "twelve pence make one shilling," "forty pence 14461
make three fourpence," triumphantly demanded, 14462
done me, "now! much forty-three pence?" replied, 14463
long interval reflection, "i know." 14464
aggravated almost doubt know. 14465
mr. pumblechook worked head like screw screw me, 14466
said, "is forty-three pence seven sixpence three fardens, 14467
instance?" 14468
"yes!" said i. although sister instantly boxed ears, 14469
highly gratifying see answer spoilt joke, 14470
brought dead stop. 14471
"boy! like miss havisham?" mr. pumblechook began 14472
recovered; folding arms tight chest applying 14473
screw. 14474
"very tall dark," told him. 14475
"is she, uncle?" asked sister. 14476
mr. pumblechook winked assent; inferred 14477
never seen miss havisham, nothing kind. 14478
"good!" said mr. pumblechook conceitedly. ("this way him! 14479
beginning hold own, think, mum?") 14480
"i sure, uncle," returned mrs. joe, "i wish always; 14481
know well deal him." 14482
"now, boy! of, went today?" asked mr. 14483
pumblechook. 14484
"she sitting," answered, "in black velvet coach." 14485
mr. pumblechook mrs. joe stared one another--as well 14486
might--and repeated, "in black velvet coach?" 14487
"yes," said i. "and miss estella--that's niece, think--handed 14488

"was anybody else there?" asked mr. pumblechook. 14492
"four dogs," said i. 14493
"large small?" 14494
"immense," said i. "and fought veal-cutlets silver 14495

mr. pumblechook mrs. joe stared one another again, utter 14497
amazement. perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness 14498
torture,--and would told anything. 14499
"where coach, name gracious?" asked sister. 14500
"in miss havisham's room." stared again. "but 14501
horses it." added saving clause, moment rejecting 14502
four richly caparisoned coursers wild thoughts 14503
harnessing. 14504
"can possible, uncle?" asked mrs. joe. "what boy mean?" 14505
"i'll tell you, mum," said mr. pumblechook. "my opinion is, 14506
sedan-chair. flighty, know,--very flighty,--quite flighty 14507

"did ever see it, uncle?" asked mrs. joe. 14509
"how could i," returned, forced admission, "when never see 14510
life? never clapped eyes upon her!" 14511
"goodness, uncle! yet spoken her?" 14512
"why, know," said mr. pumblechook, testily, "that 14513

"we played flags," said. (i beg observe think 14518

"flags!" echoed sister. 14520
"yes," said i. "estella waved blue flag, waved red one, 14521
miss havisham waved one sprinkled little gold stars, 14522
coach-window. waved swords hurrahed." 14523
"swords!" repeated sister. "where get swords from?" 14524
"out cupboard," said i. "and saw pistols it,--and jam,--and 14525
pills. daylight room, lighted 14526
candles." 14527
"that's true, mum," said mr. pumblechook, grave nod. "that's 14528
state case, much i've seen myself." 14529

"if fool's head can't express better opinions that," said 14554
sister, "and got work do, better go it." 14555

mr. pumblechook driven off, sister washing up, 14557

"oh!" said joe. "you husband sister boy?" 15564
could hardly imagined dear old joe looking unlike 15565

tuft feathers ruffled, mouth open wanted worm. 15567
"you husband," repeated miss havisham, "of sister 15568

"well!" said miss havisham. "and reared boy, 15576

"have brought indentures you?" asked miss havisham. 15595
"well, pip, know," replied joe, little 15596
unreasonable, "you see put 'em 'at, therefore 15597

round convincing sound said twice. 15630
"good-bye, pip!" said miss havisham. "let out, estella." 15631
"am come again, miss havisham?" asked. 15632
"no. gargery master now. gargery! one word!" 15633
thus calling back went door, heard say joe 15634

daylight alone again, joe backed wall, said me, 15643
"astonishing!" remained long saying, "astonishing" 15644

"compliments," said. 15660
"which belief," answered joe; "her compliments mrs. 15661

"much good they'll me!" observed sister; rather gratified too. 15663
"and wishing," pursued joe, another fixed look me, like another 15664

"and much got?" asked sister, laughing. positively 15683
laughing! 15684
"what would present company say ten pound?" demanded joe. 15685
"they'd say," returned sister, curtly, "pretty well. much, 15686
pretty well." 15687
"it's that, then," said joe. 15688
fearful impostor, pumblechook, immediately nodded, said, 15689
rubbed arms chair, "it's that, mum." 15690
"why, mean say--" began sister. 15691
"yes do, mum," said pumblechook; "but wait bit. go on, joseph. good 15692

patronizing laugh, "it's that, mum. good again! follow up, 15698
joseph!" 15699
"then make end it," said joe, delightedly handing bag 15700

"joe," said i; "don't think ought make miss havisham visit?" 15892
"well, pip," returned joe, slowly considering. "what for?" 15893
"what for, joe? visit made for?" 15894
"there wisits p'r'aps," said joe, "as ever remains open 15895
question, pip. regard wisiting miss havisham. might 15896
think wanted something,--expected something her." 15897
"don't think might say not, joe?" 15898
"you might, old chap," said joe. "and might credit it. similarly 15899
mightn't." 15900
joe felt, did, made point there, pulled hard 15901
pipe keep weakening repetition. 15902
"you see, pip," joe pursued, soon past danger, "miss 15903
havisham done handsome thing you. miss havisham done 15904
handsome thing you, called back say 15905
all." 15906
"yes, joe. heard her." 15907
"all," joe repeated, emphatically. 15908
"yes, joe. tell you, heard her." 15909
"which meantersay, pip, might meaning were,--make 15910

"but, joe." 15916
"yes, old chap." 15917
"here i, getting first year time, and, since day 15918
bound, never thanked miss havisham, asked 15919
her, shown remember her." 15920
"that's true, pip; unless turn set shoes 15921

"i mean sort remembrance, joe; mean present." 15925
joe got idea present head must harp upon it. 15926
"or even," said he, "if helped knocking new chain 15927

"i mean present all, joe," interposed. 15932
"well," said joe, still harping though particularly 15933
pressed it, "if yourself, pip, wouldn't. no, would not. 15934
what's door-chain got one always up? shark-headers 15935

joe, steadfastly impressing upon me, endeavouring 15939
rouse fixed delusion, "and may haim like, 15940
gridiron come out, either leave leave, 15941
can't help yourself--" 15942
"my dear joe," cried, desperation, taking hold coat, "don't 15943
go way. never thought making miss havisham present." 15944
"no, pip," joe assented, contending that, 15945
along; "and say is, right, pip." 15946
"yes, joe; wanted say, was, rather slack 15947
now, would give half-holiday to-morrow, think would 15948
go uptown make call miss est--havisham." 15949
"which name," said joe, gravely, "ain't estavisham, pip, unless 15950

"i know, joe, know. slip mine. think it, 15952

"well then, old orlick, he's going town," retorted 16002
worthy. "two go town. tain't one wot go town. 16003

finally said, hammered hot iron cold, 16012
leaned hammer,-- 16013
"now, master!" 16014
"are right now?" demanded joe. 16015
"ah! right," said gruff old orlick. 16016
"then, general stick work well men," said 16017
joe, "let half-holiday all." 16018
sister standing silent yard, within hearing,--she 16019
unscrupulous spy listener,--and instantly looked 16020

"like you, fool!" said joe, "giving holidays great idle 16022
hulkers like that. rich man, upon life, waste wages 16023
way. wish master!" 16024
"you'd everybody's master, durst," retorted orlick, 16025
ill-favored grin. 16026
("let alone," said joe.) 16027
"i'd match noodles rogues," returned sister, 16028
beginning work mighty rage. "and 16029
match noodles, without match master, who's 16030
dunder-headed king noodles. match 16031
rogues, without match you, blackest-looking 16032

"you're foul shrew, mother gargery," growled journeyman. "if 16034

("let alone, you?" said joe.) 16036
"what say?" cried sister, beginning scream. "what 16037
say? fellow orlick say me, pip? call me, 16038
husband standing by? oh! oh! oh!" exclamations 16039
shriek; must remark sister, equally true 16040
violent women ever seen, passion excuse 16041

consciously deliberately took extraordinary pains force 16043

oh!" 16046
"ah-h-h!" growled journeyman, teeth, "i'd hold you, 16047

("i tell you, let alone," said joe.) 16049
"oh! hear him!" cried sister, clap hands 16050
scream together,--which next stage. "to hear names he's 16051
giving me! orlick! house! me, married woman! 16052
husband standing by! oh! oh!" sister, fit clappings 16053
screamings, beat hands upon bosom upon knees, 16054
threw cap off, pulled hair down,--which last stages 16055
road frenzy. time perfect fury complete 16056
success, made dash door fortunately locked. 16057
could wretched joe now, disregarded parenthetical 16058
interruptions, stand journeyman, ask meant 16059
interfering betwixt mrs. joe; whether 16060
man enough come on? old orlick felt situation admitted 16061
nothing less coming on, defence straightway; so, 16062
without much pulling singed burnt aprons, went 16063
one another, like two giants. but, man neighborhood 16064
could stand uplong joe, never saw man. orlick, 16065

"well?" said she, fixing eyes upon me. "i hope want nothing? 16097
get nothing." 16098
"no indeed, miss havisham. wanted know 16099

"there, there!" old restless fingers. "come then; come 16101

barnwell began go wrong, declare felt positively apologetic, 16138
pumblechook's indignant stare taxed it. wopsle, too, took 16139

dark night over, set 16151
mr. wopsle walk home. beyond town, found heavy mist out, 16152

old orlick growled, nothing say that, 16165

"ay! there's birds flown cages. guns 16172

effect, walked many yards further, 16174
well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened mist, heavily 16175
rolled away along low grounds river, pursuing 16176
threatening fugitives. 16177
"a good night cutting in," said orlick. "we'd puzzled 16178
bring jail-bird wing, to-night." 16179
subject suggestive one me, thought 16180
silence. mr. wopsle, ill-requited uncle evening's tragedy, 16181
fell meditating aloud garden camberwell. orlick, 16182

"biddy," said i, "how manage it? either stupid, 16406
clever." 16407
"what manage? know," returned biddy, smiling. 16408
managed whole domestic life, wonderfully too; 16409
mean that, though made mean surprising. 16410
"how manage, biddy," said i, "to learn everything learn, 16411
always keep me?" beginning rather vain 16412
knowledge, spent birthday guineas it, set aside 16413
greater part pocket-money similar investment; though 16414
doubt, now, little knew extremely dear price. 16415
"i might well ask you," said biddy, "how manage?" 16416
"no; come forge night, one see 16417

"i suppose must catch like cough," said biddy, quietly; went 16419

pursuing idea leaned back wooden chair, looked 16421
biddy sewing away head one side, began think rather 16422

"you one those, biddy," said i, "who make every 16428

biddy looked instant, went sewing. "i 16431

"biddy!" exclaimed, amazement. "why, crying!" 16433
"no not," said biddy, looking laughing. "what put 16434

"yes, biddy," observed, done turning over, "you 16451

"ah, poor thing!" replied biddy. like self-forgetfulness 16454

"well!" said i, "we must talk together little more, used do. 16457

"biddy," said i, binding secrecy, "i want 16470
gentleman." 16471
"o, wouldn't, you!" returned. "i think would 16472
answer." 16473
"biddy," said i, severity, "i particular reasons 16474
wanting gentleman." 16475
"you know best, pip; think happier are?" 16476
"biddy," exclaimed, impatiently, "i happy am. 16477
disgusted calling life. never taken 16478
either, since bound. absurd." 16479
"was absurd?" said biddy, quietly raising eyebrows; "i sorry 16480
that; mean be. want well, 16481
comfortable." 16482
"well, then, understand never shall 16483

different sort life life lead now." 16485
"that's pity!" said biddy, shaking head sorrowful air. 16486
now, often thought pity, that, singular kind 16487
quarrel always carrying on, half inclined 16488

regretted, still helped. 16491
"if could settled down," said biddy, plucking short 16492

biddy sighed looked ships sailing on, returned 16502

knew meant well. 16504
"instead that," said i, plucking grass chewing blade 16505

would signify me, coarse common, nobody told 16507
so!" 16508
biddy turned face suddenly towards mine, looked far 16509
attentively looked sailing ships. 16510
"it neither true polite thing say," 16511
remarked, directing eyes ships again. "who said it?" 16512
disconcerted, broken away without quite seeing 16513
going to. shuffled now, however, 16514
answered, "the beautiful young lady miss havisham's, 16515
beautiful anybody ever was, admire dreadfully, want 16516
gentleman account." made lunatic confession, 16517
began throw torn-up grass river, 16518
thoughts following it. 16519
"do want gentleman, spite gain over?" biddy 16520
quietly asked me, pause. 16521
"i know," moodily answered. 16522
"because, spite her," biddy pursued, "i think--but 16523
know best--that might better independently done 16524
caring nothing words. gain over, 16525
think--but know best--she worth gaining over." 16526
exactly thought, many times. exactly 16527
perfectly manifest moment. could i, poor dazed 16528
village lad, avoid wonderful inconsistency best 16529
wisest men fall every day? 16530
"it may quite true," said biddy, "but admire 16531

biddy wisest girls, tried reason me. 16539
put hand, comfortable hand though roughened work, 16540
upon hands, one another, gently took hair. 16541
softly patted shoulder soothing way, face 16542
upon sleeve cried little,--exactly done brewery 16543

somebody, everybody; can't say which. 16545
"i glad one thing," said biddy, "and is, felt 16546

said, fresh pleasant change voice, "shall walk 16554

"biddy," cried, getting up, putting arm round neck, giving 16556
kiss, "i shall always tell everything." 16557
"till gentleman," said biddy. 16558
"you know never shall be, that's always. 16559
occasion tell anything, know everything know,--as 16560
told home night." 16561
"ah!" said biddy, quite whisper, looked away ships. 16562
repeated, former pleasant change, "shall walk 16563
little farther, go home?" 16564
said biddy would walk little farther, so, 16565
summer afternoon toned summer evening, 16566
beautiful. began consider whether naturally 16567
wholesomely situated, all, circumstances, playing 16568
beggar neighbor candle-light room stopped clocks, 16569
despised estella. thought would good 16570
could get head, rest remembrances 16571

stick it, make best it. asked question 16573
whether surely know estella beside 16574
moment instead biddy, would make miserable? obliged 16575
admit know certainty, said myself, "pip, 16576
fool are!" 16577
talked good deal walked, biddy said seemed 16578
right. biddy never insulting, capricious, biddy to-day 16579
somebody else to-morrow; would derived pain, 16580
pleasure, giving pain; would far rather wounded 16581

better two? 16583
"biddy," said i, walking homeward, "i wish could put 16584
right." 16585
"i wish could!" said biddy. 16586
"if could get fall love you,--you mind 16587
speaking openly old acquaintance?" 16588
"oh dear, all!" said biddy. "don't mind me." 16589
"if could get it, would thing me." 16590
"but never will, see," said biddy. 16591
appear quite unlikely evening, would 16592
done discussed hours before. therefore observed 16593
quite sure that. biddy said was, said 16594
decisively. heart believed right; yet took 16595
rather ill, too, positive point. 16596
came near churchyard, cross embankment, 16597
get stile near sluice-gate. started up, gate, 16598

"halloa!" growled, "where two going?" 16601
"where going, home?" 16602
"well, then," said he, "i'm jiggered see home!" 16603
penalty jiggered favorite supposititious case 16604

biddy much going us, said whisper, 16610
"don't let come; like him." like either, 16611
took liberty saying thanked him, want 16612
seeing home. received piece information yell 16613
laughter, dropped back, came slouching us little 16614

curious know whether biddy suspected hand 16616

account, asked like him. 16618
"oh!" replied, glancing shoulder slouched us, 16619
"because i--i afraid likes me." 16620
"did ever tell liked you?" asked indignantly. 16621
"no," said biddy, glancing shoulder again, "he never told 16622
so; dances me, whenever catch eye." 16623
however novel peculiar testimony attachment, 16624
doubt accuracy interpretation. hot indeed upon 16625
old orlick's daring admire her; hot outrage 16626

"but makes difference you, know," said biddy, calmly. 16628
"no, biddy, makes difference me; like it; 16629
approve it." 16630
"nor neither," said biddy. "though makes difference you." 16631
"exactly," said i; "but must tell opinion you, 16632
biddy, danced consent." 16633

began suspect mr. wopsle man thought 16741
him, beginning found out. 16742
"and man, remember," pursued gentleman, throwing 16743
finger mr. wopsle heavily,--"that man might summoned 16744

quite rush him. mr. jaggers, putting hand shoulder 17726
walking side without saying anything me, addressed 17727
followers. 17728
first, took two secret men. 17729
"now, nothing say you," said mr. jaggers, throwing 17730
finger them. "i want know know. result, 17731

"yes, mr. jaggers." 17752
"and remember," retorted mr. jaggers, "that 17753

"you're late," said mr. jaggers. "i way." 17775
"holy father, mithter jaggerth!" cried excitable acquaintance, 17776
turning white, "don't thay habraham latharuth!" 17777
"i am," said mr. jaggers, "and there's end it. get 17778

"what prepared swear?" 17797
"well, mas'r jaggers," said mike, wiping nose fur cap 17798
time; "in general way, anythink." 17799
mr. jaggers suddenly became irate. "now, warned before," said 17800
he, throwing forefinger terrified client, "that ever 17801
presumed talk way here, i'd make example you. 17802
infernal scoundrel, dare tell that?" 17803
client looked scared, bewildered too, unconscious 17804

"spooney!" said clerk, low voice, giving stir 17806
elbow. "soft head! need say face face?" 17807
"now, ask you, blundering booby," said guardian, sternly, 17808
"once last time, man brought 17809

helpless casting about, mike brightened began again:-- 17821
"he dressed like 'spectable pieman. sort pastry-cook." 17822
"is here?" asked guardian. 17823
"i left him," said mike, "a setting doorsteps round corner." 17824
"take past window, let see him." 17825

housekeeper time clearing table; guardian, 19312
taking heed her, side face turned her, 19313
leaning back chair biting side forefinger 19314
showing interest drummle, that, me, quite inexplicable. 19315
suddenly, clapped large hand housekeeper's, like trap, 19316
stretched across table. suddenly smartly 19317
this, stopped foolish contention. 19318
"if talk strength," said mr. jaggers, "i'll show wrist. 19319
molly, let see wrist." 19320
entrapped hand table, already put 19321
hand behind waist. "master," said, low voice, eyes 19322
attentively entreatingly fixed upon him. "don't." 19323
"i'll show wrist," repeated mr. jaggers, immovable 19324
determination show it. "molly, let see wrist." 19325
"master," murmured. "please!" 19326
"molly," said mr. jaggers, looking her, obstinately looking 19327
opposite side room, "let see wrists. show 19328

took hand hers, turned wrist table. 19330
brought hand behind her, held two side 19331

"there's power here," said mr. jaggers, coolly tracing sinews 19336
forefinger. "very men power wrist 19337
woman has. remarkable mere force grip 19338

stronger respect, man's woman's, these." 19340
said words leisurely, critical style, continued 19341
look every one us regular succession sat. moment 19342
ceased, looked again. "that'll do, molly," said mr. 19343
jaggers, giving slight nod; "you admired, 19344
go." withdrew hands went room, mr. jaggers, 19345
putting decanters dumb-waiter, filled glass 19346
passed round wine. 19347
"at half-past nine, gentlemen," said he, "we must break up. pray make 19348
best use time. glad see all. mr. drummle, 19349

object singling drummle bring still more, 19351
perfectly succeeded. sulky triumph, drummle showed morose 19352
depreciation rest us, offensive degree, 19353
became downright intolerable. stages, mr. 19354
jaggers followed strange interest. actually seemed 19355
serve zest mr. jaggers's wine. 19356
boyish want discretion dare say took much drink, 19357
know talked much. became particularly hot upon 19358
boorish sneer drummle's, effect free 19359
money. led remarking, zeal discretion, 19360
came bad grace him, startop lent money 19361
presence week before. 19362
"well," retorted drummle; "he'll paid." 19363
"i mean imply won't," said i, "but might make 19364
hold tongue us money, think." 19365
"you think!" retorted drummle. "oh lord!" 19366
"i dare say," went on, meaning severe, "that 19367
lend money us wanted it." 19368
"you right," said drummle. "i lend one sixpence. 19369
lend anybody sixpence." 19370
"rather mean borrow circumstances, say." 19371
"you say," repeated drummle. "oh lord!" 19372
aggravating--the especially found 19373
making way surly obtuseness--that said, disregarding 19374
herbert's efforts check me,-- 19375
"come, mr. drummle, since subject, i'll tell 19376
passed herbert me, borrowed money." 19377
"i want know passed herbert you," 19378

"i'll tell you, however," said i, "whether want know not. 19381
said put pocket glad get it, seemed 19382
immensely amused weak lend it." 19383
drummle laughed outright, sat laughing faces, hands 19384
pockets round shoulders raised; plainly signifying 19385
quite true, despised us asses all. 19386
hereupon startop took hand, though much better grace 19387
shown, exhorted little agreeable. startop, 19388
lively, bright young fellow, drummle exact 19389
opposite, latter always disposed resent direct 19390
personal affront. retorted coarse, lumpish way, startop 19391
tried turn discussion aside small pleasantry made 19392
us laugh. resenting little success anything, drummle, 19393
without threat warning, pulled hands pockets, 19394
dropped round shoulders, swore, took large glass, would 19395
flung adversary's head, entertainer's 19396
dexterously seizing instant raised 19397

even walk hammersmith side way; herbert i, 19405
remained town, saw going street opposite sides; 19406
startop leading, drummle lagging behind shadow houses, 19407

"pooh!" said he, sluicing face, speaking 19416
water-drops; "it's nothing, pip. like spider though." 19417
turned towards now, shaking head, blowing, 19418
towelling himself. 19419
