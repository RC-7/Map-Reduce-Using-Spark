leaves long, grass green, 0
hemlock-umbels tall fair, 1
glade light seen 2
stars shadow shimmering. 3
tinuviel dancing 4
music pipe unseen, 5
light stars hair, 6
raiment glimmering. 7

beren came mountains cold, 9
lost wandered leaves, 10
elven-river rolled. 11
walked along sorrowing. 12
peered hemlock-leaves 13
saw wonder flowers gold 14
upon mantle sleeves, 15
hair like shadow following. 16
17
enchantment healed weary feet 18
hills doomed roam; 19
forth hastened, strong fleet, 20
grasped moonbeams glistening. 21
woven woods elvenhome 22
lightly fled dancing feet, 23
left lonely still roam 24
silent forest listening. 25
26
heard oft flying sound 27
feet light linden-leaves, 28
music welling underground, 29
hidden hollows quavering. 30
withered lay hemlock-sheaves, 31
one one sighing sound 32
whispering fell beechen leaves 33
wintry woodland wavering. 34
35
sought ever, wandering far 36
leaves years thickly strewn, 37
light moon ray star 38
frosty heavens shivering. 39
mantle glinted moon, 40
hill-top high far 41
danced, feet strewn 42
mist silver quivering. 43
44
winter passed, came again, 45
song released sudden spring, 46
like rising lark, falling rain, 47
melting water bubbling. 48
saw elven-flowers spring 49
feet, healed 50
longed dance sing 51
upon grass untroubling. 52
53
fled, swift came. 54
tinuviel! tinuviel! 55
called elvish name; 56
halted listening. 57
one moment stood she, spell 58
voice laid her: beren came, 59
doom fell tinuviel 60
arms lay glistening. 61
62
beren looked eyes 63
within shadows hair, 64
trembling starlight skies 65
saw mirrored shimmering. 66
tinuviel elven-fair, 67
immortal maiden elven-wise, 68
cast shadowy hair 69
arms like silver glimmering. 70
71
long way fate bore, 72
o'er stony mountains cold grey, 73
halls iron darkling door, 74
woods nightshade morrowless. 75
sundering seas lay, 76
yet last met more, 77
long ago passed away 78
forest singing sorrowless. 79
