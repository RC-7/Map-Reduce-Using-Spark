leaves long, grass green, 0
hemlock-umbels tall fair, 1
glade light seen 2
stars shadow shimmering. 3
tinuviel dancing 4
music pipe unseen, 5
light stars hair, 6
raiment glimmering. 7
beren came mountains cold, 8
lost wandered leaves, 9
elven-river rolled. 10
walked along sorrowing. 11
peered hemlock-leaves 12
saw wonder flowers gold 13
upon mantle sleeves, 14
hair like shadow following. 15
enchantment healed weary feet 16
hills doomed roam; 17
forth hastened, strong fleet, 18
grasped moonbeams glistening. 19
woven woods elvenhome 20
lightly fled dancing feet, 21
left lonely still roam 22
silent forest listening. 23
heard oft flying sound 24
feet light linden-leaves, 25
music welling underground, 26
hidden hollows quavering. 27
withered lay hemlock-sheaves, 28
one one sighing sound 29
whispering fell beechen leaves 30
wintry woodland wavering. 31
sought ever, wandering far 32
leaves years thickly strewn, 33
light moon ray star 34
frosty heavens shivering. 35
mantle glinted moon, 36
hill-top high far 37
danced, feet strewn 38
mist silver quivering. 39
winter passed, came again, 40
song released sudden spring, 41
like rising lark, falling rain, 42
melting water bubbling. 43
saw elven-flowers spring 44
feet, healed 45
longed dance sing 46
upon grass untroubling. 47
fled, swift came. 48
tinuviel! tinuviel! 49
called elvish name; 50
halted listening. 51
one moment stood she, spell 52
voice laid her: beren came, 53
doom fell tinuviel 54
arms lay glistening. 55
beren looked eyes 56
within shadows hair, 57
trembling starlight skies 58
saw mirrored shimmering. 59
tinuviel elven-fair, 60
immortal maiden elven-wise, 61
cast shadowy hair 62
arms like silver glimmering. 63
long way fate bore, 64
o'er stony mountains cold grey, 65
halls iron darkling door, 66
woods nightshade morrowless. 67
sundering seas lay, 68
yet last met more, 69
long ago passed away 70
forest singing sorrowless. 71
