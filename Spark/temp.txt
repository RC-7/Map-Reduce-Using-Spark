The leaves long, grass green, 0
The hemlock-umbels tall fair, 1
And glade light seen 2
Of stars shadow shimmering. 3
Tinuviel dancing 4
To music pipe unseen, 5
And light stars hair, 6
And raiment glimmering. 7
8
There Beren came mountains cold, 9
And lost wandered leaves, 10
And Elven-river rolled. 11
He walked along sorrowing. 12
He peered hemlock-leaves 13
And saw wonder flowers gold 14
Upon mantle sleeves, 15
And hair like shadow following. 16
17
Enchantment healed weary feet 18
That hills doomed roam; 19
And forth hastened, strong fleet, 20
And grasped moonbeams glistening. 21
Through woven woods Elvenhome 22
She lightly fled dancing feet, 23
And left lonely still roam 24
In silent forest listening. 25
26
He heard oft flying sound 27
Of feet light linden-leaves, 28
Or music welling underground, 29
In hidden hollows quavering. 30
Now withered lay hemlock-sheaves, 31
And one one sighing sound 32
Whispering fell beechen leaves 33
In wintry woodland wavering. 34
35
He sought ever, wandering far 36
Where leaves years thickly strewn, 37
By light moon ray star 38
In frosty heavens shivering. 39
Her mantle glinted moon, 40
As hill-top high far 41
She danced, feet strewn 42
A mist silver quivering. 43
44
When winter passed, came again, 45
And song released sudden spring, 46
Like rising lark, falling rain, 47
And melting water bubbling. 48
He saw elven-flowers spring 49
About feet, healed 50
He longed dance sing 51
Upon grass untroubling. 52
53
Again fled, swift came. 54
Tinuviel! Tinuviel! 55
He called elvish name; 56
And halted listening. 57
One moment stood she, spell 58
His voice laid her: Beren came, 59
And doom fell Tinuviel 60
That arms lay glistening. 61
62
As Beren looked eyes 63
Within shadows hair, 64
The trembling starlight skies 65
He saw mirrored shimmering. 66
Tinuviel elven-fair, 67
Immortal maiden elven-wise, 68
About cast shadowy hair 69
And arms like silver glimmering. 70
71
Long way fate bore, 72
O'er stony mountains cold grey, 73
Through halls iron darkling door, 74
And woods nightshade morrowless. 75
The Sundering Seas lay, 76
And yet last met more, 77
And long ago passed away 78
In forest singing sorrowless. 79
